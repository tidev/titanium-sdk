And much, much more (see our [Documentation](https://titaniumsdk.com/) for more infos).

## Hyperloop

Use Hyperloop, our latest addition to the Appcelerator Platform, to extend your Titanium SDK apps by native API's using
JavaScript. Prior to Hyperloop, you would use [native modules](https://titaniumsdk.com/guide/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_How-tos/Extending_Titanium_Mobile/Titanium_Module_Concepts.html) to extend the Titanium SDK API. With
Hyperloop, you are now able to implement native classes, 3rd-Party libraries (Cocoapods, local frameworks, .aar files)
and more directly into your apps. Hyperloop is available for iOS, Android and Windows Phone (Tech Preview).

### Features

#### Cross-Platform Reuse

Build and maintain apps in a fraction of the time with up to 95% code reuse.

#### Direct API Access

Access 100% of platform APIs directly, with instant support for each new OS release.

#### JavaScript Everywhere

Create mobile apps using the world’s most popular programming language.

#### 3rd-Party Libraries

Incorporate 3rd-party native libraries using JavaScript, with no changes required.

#### Custom Animations

Easily create complex custom effects like dynamic animations using JavaScript.

#### Run Native

Mobile app development for every major mobile OS – with no hybrid compromises.

### Example

Create a native view in iOS and Android:

```js
// iOS
var view = new UIView();

// Android
var view = new View(activity);
```

### Getting Started

Check out our [Hyperloop Sample App](https://github.com/tidev/hyperloop-examples) and [Hyperloop Programming Guide](https://titaniumsdk.com/guide/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Guide/Hyperloop/) to get started with Hyperloop today!

## Alloy

[Alloy](https://titaniumsdk.com/guide/Alloy_Framework/Alloy_Getting_Started.html) is the MVC application framework built
on top of Titanium SDK. It is optional. It rocks. Check it out if you're considering using Titanium SDK.
It is also a separate [open source project](https://github.com/tidev/alloy) available under Apache Public License.

### Example

Manage your application scope by separating your code into different models, views, controllers and more:

**index.xml** (View)

```xml
<Alloy>
  <Window title="Titanium SDK and Alloy">
    <Button onClick="handleClick" id="myButton">Click me!</Button>
  </Window>
</Alloy>
```

**index.js** (Controller)

```js
function handleClick() {
  alert('Hello from the Controller!');
}
```

**index.tss** (Style)

```js
Window: {
  backgroundColor: 'white'
}

"#myButton": {
  width: 200,
  height: 30,
  backgroundColor: 'green'
}
```

## Contributing

Titanium SDK is an open source project. Titanium SDK wouldn't be where it is now without contributions by the community. Please consider forking Titanium SDK to improve, enhance or fix issues. If you feel like the community will benefit from your fork, please open a pull request.

To protect the interests of the Titanium SDK contributors, Appcelerator, customers and end users we require contributors to sign a Contributors License Agreement (CLA) before we pull the changes into the main repository. Our CLA is simple and straightforward - it requires that the contributions you make to any Appcelerator open source project are properly licensed and that you have the legal authority to make those changes. This helps us significantly reduce future legal risk for everyone involved. It is easy, helps everyone, takes only a few minutes, and only needs to be completed once.

[You can digitally sign the CLA](https://github.com/tidev/organization-docs/blob/main/AUTHORIZED_CONTRIBUTORS.md) online. Please indicate your email address in your first pull request so that we can make sure that will locate your CLA.  Once you've submitted it, you no longer need to send one for subsequent submissions.

## Building Locally

If you'd like to build the SDK locally you can use the included npm scripts:

```bash
npm ci
npm run cleanbuild
```

The build and package commands will default to all target platforms on your host OS unless explicitly specified. (i.e. Android, iOS on macOS; Windows and Android on Windows). It will compile, package and install the locally-built SDK for you
as well, so you can test it in your own applications without any further procedures.

The build command will look for the Android SDK directory path via the $ANDROID_SDK env variables if not explicitly passed using command line arguments.

You can use the `-h` flag to display the full list of comands and options.

```bash
npm ci
npm run cleanbuild -- [platform1] [platform2] --android-sdk /opt/android-sdk /Users/build/android-sdk-macosx
```

### Unit tests

We have a [unit test suite](tests/) intended to run across all supported platforms.

We have npm scripts set up to run a full clean, build, package, symlinked install, `ti sdk select` the built sdk, and then run the unit test suite:

```bash
npm run test:android
npm run test:iphone
npm run test:ipad
```

#### How it works

The test suite generates a single Titanium SDK project targeting the specified platform(s), builds the project for emulator, launches the app on the emulator and then runs a series of tests defined via ti-mocha and should.js.

The tests spit out their results to the console log, and the test scripts listen to the logs to gather the results. We then generate an overview on the console as well as a junit report xml file (to be consume by CI build systems like Jenkins).

#### How to modify the tests locally and in your PRs

The `tests` folder contains the test suite. Any files living within that directory are copied on top of the test app's structure.


### Upgrade gradle and gradle plugin

The gradle (tool, build system) and gradle plugin (plugin that adds several features that are specific to building Android apps) version numbers are located in:
* `android/build.gradle`
* `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`
* `android/templates/build/root.build.gradle`.

You can run `./android/gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 7.4.2 --distribution-type all` to update the gradle tool. It will download the version, change the `gradle-wrapper.properties` link, update the gradlew file and the gradle-wrapper.jar.
To update the plugin to a newer version (check https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.android.tools.build/gradle?repo=google) you have to change the `build.gradle` and `root.build.gradle` from the links above.
When you change the gradle plugin make sure to look at the `Compatibility` section at https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin#compatibility-7-1-0 and adjust the `android build tools` section in `android/package.json`.
If needed make sure the other libraries e.g. the kotlin version in `build.gradle` are working with the current setup.

After you've made the changes and compiled the SDK make sure to run the test suite, build the kitchensink and hyperloop example app. Create a and build a module (java and kotlin) and run those in a test app too.

### Update packaged modules

Some modules like ti.map or ti.facebook are included with the SDK. To update to the latest versions you have to edit the links in `support/module/packaged/modules.json` and run `node build/scons-modules-integrity.js`. This will download the files and update the integrity values.
