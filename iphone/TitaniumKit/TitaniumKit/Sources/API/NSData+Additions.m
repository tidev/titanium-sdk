// we use 128 bits vs 256 as a much better performance alternative
// and given the size of 128 bits and the fact that 128 is approved
// for NSA top secret .. we're probably OK at this point.  at some
// point maybe we allow this to be increased... but for now... here's
// some commentary on the 128 bit issue:
//
// Assuming that one could build a machine that could recover a DES
// key in a second (i.e., try 255 keys per second), it would take that
// machine approximately 149 thousand billion (149 trillion) years to
// crack a 128-bit AES key. To put that into perspective, the universe
// is believed to be fewer than 20 billion years old.
