/**
 * Protocol for interacting with an SQL database.
 *
 * @par Object Types
 * All drivers support conversion to and from the following object types:
 * - NSString
 * - NSNumber
 * - NSData
 *
 * @par Scalar Types
 * All drivers implement conversion to and from the scalar types as defined in
 * the Key Value Coding documentation, Scalar and Structure Support:
 * http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueCoding/Concepts/DataTypes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20002171-184842-BCIJIBHC
 *
 * @par
 * The mapping of these scalar types to specific database types is implementation
 * defined. Refer to the database driver's documentation for the specific mapping
 * used.
 *
 * @par Thread Safety
 * PLDatabase instances implement no locking and must not be shared between threads
 * without external synchronization.
