/*
 *  For functions and other objects that need to be held by proxies without
 *  conversion or possible retain cycles, KrollWrapper passively refers to a
 *  JS Object. In the future, this should become the base class, instead of a
 *  collection of Kroll wrappers all based off of NSObject despite common
 *  functionality.
 *
 *  NOTE: This is an object that is never made explicitly by TiIdToValue;
 *  instead, all JS functions become KrollCallbacks, and both KrollCallbacks
 *  and KrollObjectProperties will be converted into functions.
 *  (or JSObjectRefs at any rate)
 *  Instead, KrollWrapper is used in two places currently: When a function is
 *  retained as a property by a proxy (to avoid the above retain loop),
 *  and for JS-based modules which do not need proxy properties but do need to
 *  be first-class JS object citizens.
 *  TODO: Consolidate various KrollObjects, KrollCallbacks, etc to be
 *  KrollWrappers.
