/**
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 * NOTES ON CONFIGURATION STRUCTURE
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Out of the box, ESLint does not support TypeScript or HTML. Naturally those are the two
 * main file types we care about in Angular projects, so we have to do a little extra work
 * to configure ESLint exactly how we need to.
 *
 * Fortunately, ESLint gives us an "overrides" configuration option which allows us to set
 * different lint tooling (parser, plugins, rules etc) for different file types, which is
 * critical because our .ts files require a different parser and different rules to our
 * .html (and our inline Component) templates.

     * EXTRACT INLINE TEMPLATES (from within .component.ts)
     * -----------------------------------------------------
     *
     * This extra piece of configuration is necessary to extract inline
     * templates from within Component metadata, e.g.:
     *
     * @Component({
     *  template: `<h1>Hello, World!</h1>`
     * })

     * if it were a full .html file, and it will therefore match the configuration
     * specific for *.component.html above when it comes to actual rules etc.
     *
     * NOTE: This processor will skip a lot of work when it runs if you don't use
     * inline templates in your projects currently, so there is no great benefit
     * in removing it, but you can if you want to.
     *
     * You won't specify any rules here. As noted above, the rules that are relevant
     * to inline templates are the same as the ones defined for *.component.html.
