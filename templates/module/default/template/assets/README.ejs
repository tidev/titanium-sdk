Place your assets like PNG files in this directory and they will be packaged
with your module.

All JavaScript files in the assets directory are IGNORED except if you create a
file named "<%- moduleId %>.js" in this directory in which case it will be
wrapped by native code, compiled, and used as your module. This allows you to
run pure JavaScript modules that are pre-compiled.
