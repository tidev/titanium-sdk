  "readme": "# graceful-fs\n\ngraceful-fs functions as a drop-in replacement for the fs module,\nmaking various improvements.\n\nThe improvements are meant to normalize behavior across different\nplatforms and environments, and to make filesystem access more\nresilient to errors.\n\n## Improvements over [fs module](http://api.nodejs.org/fs.html)\n\ngraceful-fs:\n\n* Queues up `open` and `readdir` calls, and retries them once\n  something closes if there is an EMFILE error from too many file\n  descriptors.\n* fixes `lchmod` for Node versions prior to 0.6.2.\n* implements `fs.lutimes` if possible. Otherwise it becomes a noop.\n* ignores `EINVAL` and `EPERM` errors in `chown`, `fchown` or\n  `lchown` if the user isn't root.\n* makes `lchmod` and `lchown` become noops, if not available.\n* retries reading a file if `read` results in EAGAIN error.\n\nOn Windows, it retries renaming a file for up to one second if `EACCESS`\nor `EPERM` error occurs, likely because antivirus software has locked\nthe directory.\n\n## USAGE\n\n```javascript\n// use just like fs\nvar fs = require('graceful-fs')\n\n// now go and do stuff with it...\nfs.readFileSync('some-file-or-whatever')\n```\n\n## Global Patching\n\nIf you want to patch the global fs module (or any other fs-like\nmodule) you can do this:\n\n```javascript\n// Make sure to read the caveat below.\nvar realFs = require('fs')\nvar gracefulFs = require('graceful-fs')\ngracefulFs.gracefulify(realFs)\n```\n\nThis should only ever be done at the top-level application layer, in\norder to delay on EMFILE errors from any fs-using dependencies.  You\nshould **not** do this in a library, because it can cause unexpected\ndelays in other parts of the program.\n",
