**Summary:**

You can write "mocha" style unit tests for the scripts in the `android/cli/lib` folder here.
The unit test script file must follow the below naming convention.

	test-<name>.js

**Running the tests:**

You can run all of the unit tests in this folder by doing the following:

1. Open the Terminal
2. `CD` to the `titanium_mobile` directory.
3. Enter: `npm run test:cli`

**Note:**

Our Jenkins server will automatically run these unit tests when submitting a PR to
the `titanium_mobile` github site.
