Hey there!

Thank you for the interest in contributing. We'd like to review and possibly merge as soon as possible. For this to happen, please make sure the following is in order:

- [x] Follow the instructions stated in [Contributing to Titanium](https://github.com/tidev/organization-docs/blob/main/AUTHORIZED_CONTRIBUTORS.md), including the request to squash commits, include unit tests and use clear commit titles (this will be your legacy!)
- [x] If you are fixing an issue that already has a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/tidev/titanium-sdk/issues), include the URL in your PR description
- [x] If you are fixing an issue that has no GitHub issue, create a [new issue](https://github.com/tidev/titanium-sdk/issues/new/choose) and include the URL in your PR description
- [x] Use a clear title, e.g. prefixing it with the GitHub Issue number and platform

That's it, you are good to go! If you have any further questions or problems, feel free to ask us on [Ti.Slack](https://slack.tidev.io) or [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/tidev/titanium-sdk/discussions).

Code strong! :rocket:
