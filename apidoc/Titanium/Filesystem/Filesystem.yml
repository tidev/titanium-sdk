name: Titanium.Filesystem
summary: The top level filesystem module, used to access files and directories on the device.
extends: Titanium.Module
since: "0.1"
platforms: [android, iphone, ipad]
methods:
  - name: createTempDirectory
    summary: Creates a temporary directory and returns a [File](Titanium.Filesystem.File) object representing the new directory.
    returns:
        type: Titanium.Filesystem.File
  - name: createTempFile
    summary: Creates a temporary file and returns a [File](Titanium.Filesystem.File)
        object representing the new file.
    returns:
        type: Titanium.Filesystem.File
  - name: getFile
    summary: Returns a `File` object representing the file identified by the path
        arguments.
    description: |
        Note that `getFile` does not create a file if one does not exist at the specified
        path. It returns a new `File` object referring to the specified file path. The 
        application can create a file at that path by calling 
        [write](Titanium.Filesystem.File.write) or create a directory by calling
        [createDirectory](Titanium.Filesystem.File.createDirectory) on the `File` object.

        This method takes a variable number of arguments, where each argument is treated
        as a path component. All of the arguments are joined together using the
        platform-specific path separator to make the final path.

        If a relative path is passed, the full path should be interpreted relative
        to the current file. For example, if the file `Resources/login/login.js` 
        contains the following code:
        
            var icon = Titanium.Filesystem.getFile('icon.png');

        The path is interpreted as `Resources/login/icon.png`. 

        On iOS, all relative paths are currently interpreted as relative to the
        `Resources` directory, **not** to the current context. This is a known issue
        that will be addressed in a future release.

    returns:
        type: Titanium.Filesystem.File
    parameters:
      - name: path
        summary: One or more path components. Path arguments are joined together using 
            the platform specific path separator to form the full path.
        type: String
  - name: isExternalStoragePresent
    summary: Returns `true` if the device supports external storage *and* the external storage
        device is mounted.
    description: |
        Returns `true` on Android if an external storage device, such as an SD card, is
        available for reading and writing.

        Returns `false` on iOS.
    returns:
        type: Boolean
properties:
  - name: MODE_APPEND
    summary: Constant for append mode for file operations.
    type: Number
    permission: read-only
  - name: MODE_READ
    summary: Constant for read mode for file operations.
    type: Number
    permission: read-only
  - name: MODE_WRITE
    summary: Constant for write mode for file operations.
    type: Number
    permission: read-only
  - name: applicationDataDirectory
    summary: Path to the application's data directory.
    description: |
        This is a writable directory that can be used to store applications-specific files. 

        On iOS, this directory is specifically designated for user documents, and a
        separate directory,
        [applicationSupportDirectory](Titanium.Filesystem.applicationSupportDirectory) is
        used for other application data.
        
        On iOS, files in this directory are backed up unless the
        [remoteBackup](Titanium.Filesystem.File.remoteBackup) flag is set to false.

        On Android, files in this directory cannot be accessed by other applications, so 
        it should not be used for files that must be used by another application 
        (for example, a video file that will be passed to the system's video player application).
        These files should be stored in the
        [externalStorageDirectory](Titanium.Filesystem.externalStorageDirectory).
    type: String
    permission: read-only
  - name: applicationDirectory
    summary: Path to the iOS application directory.
    type: String
    permission: read-only
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
  - name: applicationSupportDirectory
    summary: Path to the application support directory.
    description: |
        This is a writable directory used on iOS for application files that are *not* 
        user documents--including settings files, caches, and so on.
        
        On iOS, files in this directory are backed up unless the
        [remoteBackup](Titanium.Filesystem.File.remoteBackup) flag is set to false.
    type: String
    permission: read-only
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
  - name: externalStorageDirectory
    summary: Path to a directory on removable storage, such as SD card.
    description: |
        This directory can be used for storing arbitrary data. It is read/write and files
        in this directory can be passed to other applications, such as video
        players--which is not possible with the 
        [applicationDataDirectory](Titanium.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory).

        This directory may not be subject to as many memory limitations as the
        `applicationDataDirectory`, which is stored in the device's internal storage.
        Note, however, that the user may remove or replace the removable storage device
        without warning, so the application must be prepared to handle this case gracefully. 
        
        The application should check
        [isExternalStoragePresent](Titanium.Filesystem.isExternalStoragePresent) before
        accessing this location. The application should also handle any exceptions generated 
        if the storage device is unmounted during use, or if the files stored on external 
        storage are not available.
        
    type: String
    permission: read-only
    platforms: [android]
  - name: lineEnding
    summary: Platform-specific line ending constant.
    type: String
    permission: read-only
  - name: resourcesDirectory
    summary: Path to the application's resource directory.
    description: |
        This directory is read-only. If you need to modify any files in this directory,
        they must first be copied to another directory, such as  
        [applicationDataDirectory](Titanium.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory) or
        [tempDirectory](Titanium.Filesystem.tempDirectory). 
        
        On iOS, 
        writable files can also be placed in the 
        [applicationSupportDirectory](Titanium.Filesystem.applicationSupportDirectory).
        On Android, writable files can also be placed in the 
        [externalStorageDirectory](Titanium.Filesystem.externalStorageDirectory).

        Note that when running on the simulator, the resources directory may be writable,
        but it is not writable on device.
    type: String
    permission: read-only
  - name: separator
    summary: Platform-specific path separator constant.
    type: String
    permission: read-only
  - name: tempDirectory
    summary: Path for the application's temporary directory. 
    description: |
        This directory can be used for storing temporary files. Files in this directory
        may not persist when the application is shut down and restarted.
