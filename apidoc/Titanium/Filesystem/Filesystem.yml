examples:
  - title: Getting a directory for an application group (iOS)
    example: |
        This example writes a string to a text file in a shared directory

        ``` js
        var suiteDir = Ti.Filesystem.directoryForSuite('group.appc.Sharing');
        if (!suiteDir) {
            logInApp('Suite Directory not found, check Entitlements.');
            return;
        }
        var f = Ti.Filesystem.getFile(suiteDir,'emptyfile.txt');
        f.write('The file is no longer empty!');
        ```
methods:
  - name: createTempDirectory
    summary: Creates a temporary directory and returns a [File](Titanium.Filesystem.File) object representing the new directory.
    returns:
        type: Titanium.Filesystem.File

  - name: createTempFile
    summary: Creates a temporary file and returns a [File](Titanium.Filesystem.File)
        object representing the new file.
    returns:
        type: Titanium.Filesystem.File

  - name: getFile
    summary: Returns a `File` object representing the file identified by the path
        arguments.
    description: |
        Note that `getFile` does not create a file if one does not exist at the specified
        path. It returns a new `File` object referring to the specified file path. The
        application can create a file at that path by calling
        [write](Titanium.Filesystem.File.write) or create a directory by calling
        [createDirectory](Titanium.Filesystem.File.createDirectory) on the `File` object.

        This method takes a variable number of arguments, where each argument is treated
        as a path component. All of the arguments are joined together using the
        platform-specific path separator to make the final path.

        If a relative path is passed, the full path should be interpreted relative
        to the current file. For example, if the file `Resources/login/login.js`
        contains the following code:

        ``` js
        var icon = Titanium.Filesystem.getFile('icon.png');
        ```

        The path is interpreted as `Resources/login/icon.png`.

        On iOS, all relative paths are currently interpreted as relative to the
        `Resources` directory, **not** to the current context. This is a known issue
        that will be addressed in a future release.

        On iOS9, if app thinning is enabled, and the file of interest is an image file
        that was bundled with the app (not downloaded during runtime), this will not return
        the image file since it is already allocated inside the assets catalog. Please
        use [getAsset](Titanium.Filesystem.getAsset) instead for this case.

    returns:
        type: Titanium.Filesystem.File
    parameters:
      - name: path
        summary: One or more path components. Path arguments are joined together using
            the platform specific path separator to form the full path.
        type: [String, Array<String>]
        repeatable: true

  - name: getAsset
    summary: Returns a `Blob` object representing the asset catalog image identified by the path
        arguments.
    description: |
        This method is only applicable on images in assets catalogs for apps with app-thinning
        enabled on iOS. Since the bundled image has been reallocated into assets catalog, it is
        no longer accessible via the original file path. To obtain a `Blob` object representing
        this image, use the original file path as the parameter in this method instead of using it in
        [getFile](Titanium.Filesystem.getFile)

        Similar to [getFile](Titanium.Filesystem.getFile), this method takes a variable
        number of arguments, where each argument is treated as a path component.
        All of the arguments are joined together using the platform-specific path separator
        to make the final path.

        If a relative path is passed, the full path should be interpreted relative
        to the current file. For example, if the file `Resources/login/login.js`
        contains the following code:

        ``` js
        var icon = Titanium.Filesystem.getAsset('icon.png');
        ```

        The path is interpreted as `Resources/login/icon.png`.

        On iOS, all relative paths are currently interpreted as relative to the
        `Resources` directory, **not** to the current context. This is a known issue
        that will be addressed in a future release.

    returns:
        type: Titanium.Blob
    parameters:
      - name: path
        summary: One or more path components. Path arguments are joined together using
            the platform specific path separator to form the full path.

  - name: isExternalStoragePresent
    summary: Returns `true` if the device supports external storage *and* the external storage
        device is mounted.
    description: |
        Returns `true` on Android if an external storage device, such as an SD card, is
        available for reading and writing.

        Returns `false` on iOS.
    returns:
        type: Boolean

  - name: hasStoragePermissions
    summary: Returns `true` if the app has storage permissions.
    returns:
        type: Boolean
    platforms: [android]
    since: "5.4.0"

  - name: requestStoragePermissions
    summary: Requests for storage permissions
    description: |
        On Android, the request view will show if the permission is not accepted by the user, and the user did
        not check the box "Never ask again" when denying the request. If the user checks the box "Never ask again,"
        the user has to manually enable the permission in device settings.

        This method requests `Manifest.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` and `Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`.
        If you require other permissions, you can also use <Titanium.Android.requestPermissions>.
    parameters:
      - name: callback
        summary: Function to call upon user decision to grant storage access
        type: Callback<RequestStorageAccessResult>
    platforms: [android]
    since: "5.4.0"

  - name: openStream
    summary: Opens file using the <Titanium.IOStream> interface.
    parameters:
      - name: mode
        summary: |
            Access mode.
        constants: Titanium.Filesystem.MODE_*
        type: Number

      - name: path
        summary: |
            One or more path components. Path arguments are joined together using the
            platform-specific path separator to form the full path.
        type: String
    returns:
        type: Titanium.Filesystem.FileStream

  - name: directoryForSuite
    summary: Returns the path to the container directory associated with the specified security application group ID.
    description: |
        This is a writable directory used on iOS. Groups of sandboxed apps that need to share files
        and other information can request a container directory as part of their entitlements.

        When called with a valid group identifier, this method returns the location of that directory as a string.
        Returns null if the group identifier is invalid; check the app's entitlements.
    parameters:
      - name: suiteName
        summary: |
            The name of the suite.
        type: String

    summary: Constant used to set protection key to NSFileProtectionCompleteUnlessOpen in file attributes.
    description: |
        File is stored in an encrypted format on disk. Can be created while the device is locked,
        but once closed, cannot be opened again until the device is unlocked. If the file is opened when
        unlocked, you may continue to access the file normally, even if the user locks the device.

  - name: applicationCacheDirectory
    summary: Path to the application's internal cache directory.
    description: |
        Files stored in the cache directory remain after the application is closed but at the
        discretion of the operating system.

        On the Android platform, the cache is limited to 25 MB and the files remain for the lifetime
        of the application, that is, until the application is uninstalled.

        On the iOS platform, the cache does not have a size limit but the data remains until iOS
        cleans the directory to recover the disk space.
    type: String
    permission: read-only
    platforms: [android, iphone, ipad]
    since: "1.8.3"
  - name: applicationDataDirectory
    summary: Path to the application's data directory.
    description: |
        This is a writable directory that can be used to store applications-specific files.

        On iOS, this directory is specifically designated for user documents, and a
        separate directory,
        [applicationSupportDirectory](Titanium.Filesystem.applicationSupportDirectory) is
        used for other application data.

        On iOS, files in this directory are backed up unless the
        [remoteBackup](Titanium.Filesystem.File.remoteBackup) flag is set to false.

        On Android, files in this directory cannot be accessed by other applications, so
        it should not be used for files that must be used by another application
        (for example, a video file that will be passed to the system's video player application).
        These files should be stored in the
        [externalStorageDirectory](Titanium.Filesystem.externalStorageDirectory).
    type: String
    permission: read-only
  - name: applicationDirectory
    summary: Path to the iOS application directory.
    type: String
    permission: read-only
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
  - name: applicationSupportDirectory
    summary: Path to the application support directory.
    description: |
        This is a writable directory used on iOS for application files that are *not*
        user documents--including settings files, caches, and so on.

        On iOS, files in this directory are backed up unless the
        [remoteBackup](Titanium.Filesystem.File.remoteBackup) flag is set to false.
    type: String
    permission: read-only
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
  - name: externalStorageDirectory
    summary: Path to a directory on removable storage, such as SD card.
    description: |
        This directory can be used for storing arbitrary data. It is read/write and files
        in this directory can be passed to other applications, such as video
        players--which is not possible with the
        [applicationDataDirectory](Titanium.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory).

        This directory may not be subject to as many memory limitations as the
        `applicationDataDirectory`, which is stored in the device's internal storage.
        Note, however, that the user may remove or replace the removable storage device
        without warning, so the application must be prepared to handle this case gracefully.

        The application should check
        [isExternalStoragePresent](Titanium.Filesystem.isExternalStoragePresent) before
        accessing this location. The application should also handle any exceptions generated
        if the storage device is unmounted during use, or if the files stored on external
        storage are not available.

    type: String
    permission: read-only
    platforms: [android]
  - name: lineEnding
    summary: Platform-specific line ending constant.
    type: String
    permission: read-only

  - name: resourcesDirectory
    summary: Path to the application's resource directory.
    description: |
        This directory is read-only. If you need to modify any files in this directory,
        they must first be copied to another directory, such as
        [applicationDataDirectory](Titanium.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory) or
        [tempDirectory](Titanium.Filesystem.tempDirectory).

        On iOS,
        writable files can also be placed in the
        [applicationSupportDirectory](Titanium.Filesystem.applicationSupportDirectory).
        On Android, writable files can also be placed in the
        [externalStorageDirectory](Titanium.Filesystem.externalStorageDirectory).

        Note that when running on the simulator, the resources directory may be writable,
        but it is not writable on device.
    type: String
    permission: read-only
  - name: resRawDirectory
    summary: Path to the application's raw resource directory.
    description: |
        On Android, the raw resources directory can be used for resources that need to be
        accessed as individual files, not included in the Android resources bundle. For
        example, sound files placed in the raw resources directory can be accessed by
        notifications, which cannot access sound files from the resource
        directory.

        To use raw resources, place files in the `platform/android/res/raw` folder, where
        `platform` is at the top level of the project, not inside the `Resources` folder. You
        will need to create the `platform` folder and subfolders.

        This directory is read-only. If you need to modify any files in this directory,
        they must first be copied to another directory, such as
        [applicationDataDirectory](Titanium.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory) or
        [tempDirectory](Titanium.Filesystem.tempDirectory).

    platforms: [android]

    type: String
    permission: read-only
  - name: separator
    summary: Platform-specific path separator constant.
    type: String
    permission: read-only

  - name: tempDirectory
    summary: Path for the application's temporary directory.
    description: |
        This directory can be used for storing temporary files. Files in this directory
        may not persist when the application is shut down and restarted.
