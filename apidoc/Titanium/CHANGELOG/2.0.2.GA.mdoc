## Ti.Cloud and Ti.CloudPush Module Fixes

This release includes new versions of the `ti.cloud` and `ti.cloudpush` modules. The new
modules are both versioned 2.0.5. If you are using these modules and you specify a 
version number in your `tiapp.xml` file, you must update to the version number to 2.0.5 or
remove the version number. If you don't specify a version number for the module, the 
latest version is used automatically.

The updated modules provide fixes for the following issues:

*   Ti.Cloud: Repeated sign-in dialogs displayed when attempting to chat with another
    user. An issue with OAuth authentication caused the module to repeatedly prompt for authorization. 

*   Ti.CloudPush: Added support for ACS push notifications to customize the title and vibrate
    parameters.

*   Ti.CloudPush: Added sound support for ACS push notifications. Sound files must be placed in the
    `Resources/sound` folder of the application project, and specified in the push message
    _with_ the filename extension. For example:

        { "sound": "notify.wav" }

*   Ti.CloudPush: Added support for custom icons with ACS push notifications. Icons must be placed
    in the `platform/android/res/drawable` folder of the application project, and
    specified in the push message _without_ the filename extension. For example:

        { "icon": "logo" }
