Titanium Mobile 1.5.0 - 12/10/2010
==================================

This release includes general bug fixes and enhancements for Android and iPhone.
Please see the updated [Titanium Mobile Reference Documentation for 1.5.0](/apidoc/mobile/1.5.0) *These will be updated by Monday*

We have addressed almost 300 issues since 1.4.0. Thanks for everyone's reported issues and patience as we have worked a little longer on this release than we had original anticipated.

Android Breaking Change
---------------------------

There is one breaking change. The `Ti.UI.Android.createOptionMenu` and `Ti.UI.Android.OptionMenu` had to be removed to add the new improved menu support. The new API maps almost 1 to 1 onto the native Android API. There are two methods on `Ti.Android.Activity`: `onCreateOptionsMenu` and `onPrepareOptionsMenu`. When the menu button is pressed the first time, the `onCreateOptionsMenu` callback will be invoked passing in the `Menu` to which you can add `Menu Items`. Examples are available in KitchenSink that show how to use the new menu APIs. The `map_view.js` example has also been refactored to use the new APIs.
