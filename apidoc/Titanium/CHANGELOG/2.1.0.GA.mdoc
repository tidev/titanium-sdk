## About This Release

Titanium Mobile SDK Release 2.1.0 is a feature release of the Titanium Mobile SDK, including
several new features and a number of bug fixes and parity improvements. 

This release includes breaking changes that may require changes to existing
applications developed with previous releases. Please read these release notes completely
before installing and using the Release 2.1.0 SDK. In particular, you should review the
[New in This Release](#new) sections.

If you are upgrading from Titanium Mobile SDK 2.0.1, this release also includes all fixes included 
in Release 2.0.2.

For a list of issues addressed in Release 2.0.2, see the release notes for the previous
releases:

* [Release Notes for Release 2.0.2](https://titaniumsdk.com/api/)
    
Further information is available in the updated [Titanium Mobile SDK and Titanium Studio
Documentation](https://titaniumsdk.com/api/).

## New in This Release

*   Improved JavaScript code security.

*   Support for ACS Access Control Lists (ACLs). ACLs allow you to control which users can 
    read or write an ACS object. 

*   Parity enhancements for horizontal layouts. Horizontal layouts now follow the same
    rules on iOS, Android and Mobile Web. 
    
    A new property, [horizontalWrap](https://titaniumsdk.com/api/), 
    has been added to enable or disable wrapping on horizontal layouts. With
    `horizontalWrap` set to `false`, a horizontal layout lays out its children in a single
    row, left to right. With `horizontalWrap` set to `true` (default) horizontal layout
    lays out its children in multiple rows, as Android and iOS did in previous releases. 
    When wrapping is enabled, the first row is aligned at the top of the parent view --
    this matches the iOS behavior in previous releases.

    See the discussion of horizontal layout in the description for the
    [layout](https://titaniumsdk.com/api/)
    property for more details.

*   Support for Android and iOS modules combining JavaScript and native code
    ([TIMOB-9314](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-9314)).

*   `ScrollableView` scroll event enhancements. Prior to Release 2.1, the `ScrollableView`
    `scroll` event behavior was not consistent with the `scroll` event on other views. 
    On Android, it fired when dragging ended, and on iOS it fired when the view finished 
    scrolling. To be more consistent with other views, the `scroll` event was redefined to 
    fire continuously while the view is scrolling. 
    
    To obtain the previous behavior on Android, add a listener for the `dragEnd`
    event instead. To obtain the previous behavior on iOS, add a listener for the
    `scrollEnd` event instead.

*   A `volume` property was added to all media player types that didn't already support
    it.

*   Added `setObject` and `getObject` methods to
    [Ti.App.Properties](https://titaniumsdk.com/api/) 
    ([TIMOB-322](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-322)).
    
*   New unit test framework. This release includes the first version of the new Anvil unit
    test framework. Anvil is designed as a replacement for the existing Drillbit unit test
    framework, which is based on Titanium Desktop. Anvil is written in JavaScript using 
    Node.js, and is designed to allow for test automation. If you are currently using 
    Drillbit and you are interested in using Anvil, see the [`driver/README`](https://github.com/tidev/titanium-sdk/blob/master/driver/README)
    file in the Titanium Mobile GitHub repo. 
    
    Anvil supports the same basic types of tests as Drillbit, but each test suite is 
    defined as a CommonJS module. See `driver/harnessTemplate/Resources/suites` for examples of 
    Anvil test suites.
    
*   Deprecation updates. Some API members that were moved to the iOS namespace in previous
    releases are now supported on both iOS and Mobile Web, so these objects are being moved
    back into the common namespace and the previous deprecation is being reversed.

    In this release, the
    [3DMatrix](https://titaniumsdk.com/api/)
    object and the `ANIMATION_CURVE` constants are being moved back into the common namespace.

## Android Fixes and Enhancements

The following is a sample of notable new Android features and bug fixes in this release:

*   Added support for adding and removing contacts.

*   Added support for `pinch` events ([TIMOB-5224](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-5224)).

*   Added support for background gradients on views. Only linear background gradients are
    supported on Android at this point
    ([TIMOB-1125](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-1124)).

## iOS Fixes and Enhancements
-----------

The following section lists notable new iOS features and bug fixes in this release.

*   TLS version fallback. With iOS Release 5.0, Apple changed the default TLS version for
    secure HTTP from 1.0 to 1.2, causing secure HTTP connections to fail when
    communicating with older servers. With this fix, when using 
    [HTTPClient](https://titaniumsdk.com/api/)
    to access an HTTPS URL, if the initial connection fails _and no TLS version was
    specified_, the HTTP client retries the connection using TLS 1.0. 

    Other objects that use `HTTPClient` internally, such as `ImageView`, will also fall
    back to the earlier TLS version if 1.2 is not supported.

    Upgrading your servers to support TLS 1.2 is recommended.

    When running in Debug mode, a warning will be printed to the console when falling back to
    TLS 1.0.

*   Enhancements to
    [ScrollableView](https://titaniumsdk.com/api/). 
    Improvements include new properties for customizing the paging control appearance and position: 
    `pagingControlAlpha`, `pagingControlOnTop`, and `overlayEnabled`  
    ([TIMOB-8995](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-8995)). 
    
    Also, the new `hitRect` property allows a `ScrollableView` to detect touch events outside 
    of its bounds. This is useful when width of the `ScrollableView` is less than the full width of
    the parent view, and `clipViews` is set to `false`, so the edges of the previous and next views are
    displayed outside the bounds of the scrollable view.  

*   Support for custom `Info.plist` values in `tiapp.xml`. Many of the existing
    iOS-specific `tiapp.xml` values are deprecated in favor of the new values. 

    See [`tiapp.xml` and `timodule.xml` Reference](https://titaniumsdk.com/api/)
    for details.

*   Added drag and drop for map annotations ([TIMOB-1242](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-1242)).

*   Added `dragStart` and `dragEnd` events on [`TableView`](https://titaniumsdk.com/api/) objects.

*   Added [`TableView.setContentInsets`](https://titaniumsdk.com/api/)
   method to define padding around the table's contents.

*   `Ti.App` supports a new [`paused`](Titanium.App.paused) event.

*   Support for iOS system textures. The following constants, defined in
    [Ti.UI.iOS](https://titaniumsdk.com/api/), 
    can be used wherever a color value is required:

    *   `COLOR_GROUP_TABLEVIEW_BACKGROUND`. Background color for group table views. 
        In current versions of iOS, this is a blue pinstriped texture on iPhone and 
        iPod Touch devices, and is transparent on iPad devices.

    *   `COLOR_SCROLLVIEW_BACKGROUND`. System texture used behind scrollable content.
         In current versions of iOS, specifies a "linen" texture.

    *   `COLOR_UNDER_PAGE_BACKGROUND`. System texture used behind, supported in iOS 5.0
         and newer only. In current versions of iOS, specifies a "light linen" texture.

    *   `COLOR_VIEW_FLIPSIDE_BACKGROUND`. System texture used for the back side of a
        flipped view. In current versions of iOS, specifies a "dark linen" texture.

    Note that the exact representation of these textures may vary between devices and 
    between SDK versions. 

*   Undocumented properties removed. The following undocumented properties were removed:
    *   `Ti.Media.Sound` `sound` property --  use `url` instead.
    *   `Ti.UI.ScrollView` `scale` property --  use `zoomScale` instead.

*   Support for IE9/Windows Phone 7.5.

    `TableView`, and `ScrollView`.

    * `View.children` set correctly.
