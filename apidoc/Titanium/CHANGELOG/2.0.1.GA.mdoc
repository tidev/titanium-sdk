## About This Release

Titanium Mobile SDK Release 2.0.1 is a feature release of the Titanium Mobile SDK, including
several new features and a number of bug fixes and parity improvements.

_This is Release 2.0.1.GA Revision 2. The initial 2.0.1.GA release was missing the
Appcelerator Cloud Services modules (Titanium.Cloud and Titanium.CloudPush).
If you installed the initial GA release, please install this version to receive the ACS
modules._

This release includes breaking changes that may require changes to existing
applications developed with previous releases. Please read these release notes completely
before installing and using the Release 2.0.1 SDK. In particular, you should review the
following sections:

*   [Layout System Updates](#layout)
*   [Android Geolocation Enhancements](#geo)

If you are upgrading from Titanium Mobile SDK 1.8.0.1 or earlier, this release also
includes all fixes included in Releases 1.8.1 and 1.8.2.

For a list of issues addressed in these releases, see the release notes for the previous
releases:

* [Release Notes for Release 1.8.1](https://titaniumsdk.com/api/)
* [Release Notes for Release 1.8.2](https://titaniumsdk.com/api/)

Note that Release 1.8.1 included fixes related to developing modules. If you are developing iOS or Android modules, see the 1.8.1 Release Notes for more information.

Further information is available in the [Titanium Mobile SDK and Titanium Studio Documentation](https://titaniumsdk.com/api/).

## New in This Relase

* Layout System Updates

* Mobile Web Platform Release Candidate

* Android Geolocation Enhancements

* Defined Module APIs for Android and iOS

### Layout System Updates

This release implements the [Composite Layout
Specification](https://titaniumsdk.com/api/),
a major update to the UI layout system. The composite layout specification involves
several changes to the way the UI system lays out controls, so that all platforms can
follow a common layout model.

The major changes to the layout system involve:

*   Improved handling for automatic sizing of views
*   Batch layout updates for improved performance
*   Post-layout event generated when layout is complete
*   New precedence order for layout parameters

These changes affect UI behavior on all platforms, and may require application changes.

For details, see [Transitioning to the New UI Layout System](https://titaniumsdk.com/guide/Titanium_SDK/Titanium_SDK_Guide/Contributing_to_Titanium/Platform_Development/Specs/UI_Composite_Layout_Behavior_Spec.html)
in the Titanium Mobile Guides.

### Appcelerator Cloud Services Support

This release includes bundled Titanium modules for using Appcelerator Cloud Services
(ACS). ACS provides a range of backend services for mobile applications, including
user management, social integration, data storage and push notifications.

The ACS  modules are documented in the main API reference, but they are not included
in the Titanium core. To use the main ACS module, you must import it using `require`:

    var Cloud = require('ti.cloud');

To  use ACS push notifications on Android, you must also import the `Titanium.CloudPush`
module:

    var Push = require('ti.cloudpush');

To use ACS services, you must enable ACS for your project. See
[Appcelerator Cloud
Services](https://titaniumsdk.com/api/)
in the Titanium Mobile Guides
for details on how to enable ACS in a Titanium project.

For further documentation and examples of using ACS in Titanium, see the API reference for
[`Titanium.Cloud`](https://titaniumsdk.com/api/).

### Mobile Web Release Candidate Status

The Mobile Web platform is now officially in Release Candidate status.
The majority of the Titanium Mobile API is now implemented for Mobile Web.

Specifically, Mobile Web implements a cross-platform subset of the
Titanium Mobile APIs, excluding any platform-specific APIs **and** any APIs
that require features not available to applications running in a browser.

The following features are not yet implemented for Mobile Web, but will be supported
in a future release:

*   `Titanium.Database`
*   `Titanium.Media.AudioPlayer`
*   `Titanium.Media.Sound`
*   `Titanium.Network.Socket`
*   `Titanium.Network.Socket.TCP`
*   `Titanium.Stream`
*   `Titanium.UI.SearchBar`
*   `Titanium.Locale` -- local locale specific date/currency formatting is not yet
    implemented. Localized messages are implemented.

The following UI controls are not implemented because they are platform-specific controls that
have not yet been moved to a platform-specific namespace.

*   `Titanium.UI.ButtonBar`
*   `Titanium.UI.MaskedImage`
*   `Titanium.UI.Notification`
*   `Titanium.UI.3DMatrix`

Finally, the `Titanium.Contacts` module is not supported because no standard exists to
expose a device's contacts data to applications running in the browser.

Certain APIs are subject to limitations on Mobile Web because of the constraints
imposed on application running in the browser. For more information, see
[Mobile Web Limitations](https://titaniumsdk.com/api/).

### Android Geolocation Enhancements and Geolocation Simple Mode

This release includes several improvements for geolocation on Android, and a new
"simple mode" for geolocation that is supported on Android, iOS, and Mobile Web.

* Simple mode has two `accuracy` settings,  `ACCURACY_HIGH` and `ACCURACY_LOW`.
  This provides a simple, cross-platform mode for configuring location updates.
  This is the only mode supported on Mobile Web. On iOS and Android, this
  mode should only be used for applications with basic location requirements.

* For applications that have more demanding location requirements on Android,
  there is a new manual mode for fine-grained control of location updates.

* On iOS, applications can continue to use the existing geolocation capabilities.

**NOTE:** Applications using the existing geolocation capabilities in Android should either switch to simple mode or to manual mode.

For details on the new geolocation support, see:

*   [Titanium.Geolocation](https://titaniumsdk.com/api/)

### Module APIs

been documented. The module APIs are not integrated into the main documentation site, but
you can find them at the following locations:

* Android Module API Reference

* iOS Module API Reference

## iOS Fixes and Enhancements
-----------

The following section lists notable bug fixes in iOS.

*New Features*

*   Upgraded the iOS JavaScript engine, JSCore, to the version shipping with iOS 5.0.

*   Improved CommonJS module encoding.

*   `Titanium.Platform.id` now returns a per-application unique ID, instead of
    the Apple UDID.

    This change was required because Apple has changed its policies, and apps using UDID
    may now be rejected from the app store.
    ([TIMOB-8173](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-8173))

*   Newsstand content notifications. ([TIMOB-5910](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-5910))

### Using Xcode 4.3

In previous releases of Xcode, when a new version of Xcode was installed, the installer
invoked the `xcode-select` command to set the new version of Xcode as the active version.

With Xcode 4.3, Xcode is installed by default in a different directory (under
/Applications instead of under /Developer), and it does not run `xcode-select` to update
the Xcode path. If you have both Xcode 4.2 and Xcode 4.3 installed, you will need
to run `xcode-select` manually to determine which version of Xcode is used.

To select Xcode 4.3, run the following command:

    sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

To select Xcode 4.2, run the following command:

    sudo xcode-select -switch /Developer

If you installed either version of Xcode in a non-default location, you will need to
specify the appropriate path in the command.

## Mobile Web Fixes and Enhancements

With this release, the Mobile Web platform is a Release Candidate. See
[Mobile Web Platform Release Candidate Status](#mobileweb_rc) for a summary of
what is currently supported in Mobile Web as well as known limitations.

## Documentation Fixes and Enhancements

This release includes a number of documentation fixes and enhancements, including the new
unified documentation site for the Titanium Mobile SDK and Titanium Studio:

*   [Titanium Mobile SDK and Titanium Studio Documentation](https://titaniumsdk.com/api/)

*Known Issues With the Documentation Site*

*   Left-hand navigation tree occasionally stops scrolling. Reloading the site should
    fix this problem.
*   Display anomalies when a large number of tabs are open.
