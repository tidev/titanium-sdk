## About This Release

Titanium SDK Release 3.2.2 is a service pack release of the Titanium SDK, addressing high-priority
issues in previous releases. 

Notable fixed issues include support to launch the iOS simulator with Xcode 5.1 and addressing a
breaking change introduced by Android build-tools v19.0.3.

There are no updates to the other Titanium components: Alloy, Studio or the CLI.  Use the current GA
versions: Alloy 1.3.1, Studio 3.2.1 and CLI 3.2.1.

## Android SDK Tools v22.6 and Build-tools v19.0.3

If you upgrade your Android build-tools to version 19.0.3, you need to build your Android
applications using Titanium SDK 3.2.2 or greater.  You must also set your Titanium CLI to use
Titanium SDK 3.2.2.GA with the `titanium sdk select` command. For example, once you have Release
3.2.2 GA installed, run the following command:

    titanium sdk select 3.2.2.GA
    
We recommend holding off installing Android SDK tools v22.6.  There is a known issue that the
`android` command-line tool cannot  create an Android virtual device (emulator)
([Android Issue #66740](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=66740)).
Because of this issue, Studio cannot create an Android emulator.

## iOS 7.1 Support

This release includes support for iOS 7.1 and Xcode 5.1.  While performing a complete testing pass
against Release 3.2.2, the following issue was discovered:

  * [TIMOB-16603](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-16603): Xcode 5.1: If you package an
    app to the App Store and validate the app, then you will get the "App Store must be built with
    public" message
