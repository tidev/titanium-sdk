## New in This Release

In coordination with this release, a new, refactored version of the Kitchen Sink sample
application is being made available. The new version uses a more modern application
structure based on CommonJS.

There is still a separate version of Kitchen Sink for the Nook, Kindle Fire, and other 
Android devices that lack support for Google APIs. The Nook version of Kitchen Sink has
not been refactored at this time.

## Note on OS X Mountain Lion (10.8)

The Titanium Mobile SDK has not been tested on OS X Mountain
Lion (10.8). Until testing is complete, Appcelerator cannot officially support 
using any version of the Titanium SDK with OS X Mountain Lion.

After testing of the Titanium SDK on Mountain Lion is complete, Appcelerator will
release an updated statement clarifying support for Mountain Lion.
