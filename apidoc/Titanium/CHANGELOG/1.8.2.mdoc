  [TIMOB-4367](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-4367)).


Known Issues
------------

The following issues are known regressions in 1.8.2:

-   Android: When the Master/Detail Application template app is used, `JNI: DeleteGlobalRef(0xdebcce57)
    failed to find entry` warnings are repeatedly logged to the console.
    This occurs in across all Android versions, with the exception of Android 4.0.2. 
    The functionality of the application does not appear to be affected.
    [TIMOB-7831](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-7831)

-   Android (V8 only): setInterval timer becomes very slow and jumpy.
    [TIMOB-7813](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-7813)

-   Android (V8 only): 4.0 ICS - TableView -- Scrolling through tableview and clicking on
    the rows eventually crashes the application. This issue has only been reproduced on
    the Samsung Galaxy Nexus running Android 4.0.2.

        `createAnimation`. 
        [TIMOB-7517](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-7517)

    -   After animating a view, the parent view becomes transparent. 
        [TIMOB-7412](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-7412)

    [TIMOB-7240](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-7240)

    [TIMOB-7252](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-7252)

iOS Changes
-----------

The following section lists notable bug fixes in iOS.

*Bug Fixes*

-   App crashes when trying to play a sound while resuming from the background.
    [TIMOB-6763](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-6763)

-   Several fixes for memory leaks:

    -   Tab object is not released when a tab is removed from a tab group.
        [TIMOB-7644](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-7644)

    -   Tab objects are not released when a tab group is closed.
        [TIMOB-7152](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-7152)

    -   Objects not released when map annotations are removed from a map.
        [TIMOB-7467](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-7467)

-   WebView.evalJS causes application to freeze and log deadlock warning.
    [TIMOB-7616](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-7616)

-   WebView doesn't handle touch events if any parent view has a touch event listener
    defined. To use an interactive web view **and** allow the parent view to receive
    touch events that occur outside of the web view, set the web view's
    `willHandleTouches` property to `false`.
    [TIMOB-7547](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-7547)

-   Tab freezes after opening a new window from a tab, then navigating back to the root
    window.
    [TIMOB-7714](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-7714)

-   HTTPClient returns a cached result. This fix disables caching by default,
    and introduces a new, iOS-only `cache` property that can be used to enable
    caching on an HTTPClient instance.
    [TIMOB-7605](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-7605)

-   TableView and ScrollView objects generate spurious error message:
    "Adding an event listener to a proxy that isn't already in the context." 
    [TIMOB-7518](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-7518), 
    [TIMOB-7347](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-7347)

-   Calling Ti.Geolocation.getCurrentPosition or getCurrentHeading with a null
    callback causes an application crash.
    [TIMOB-7361](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-7361)

-   When a tab group specifies a different `barImage` for each window, only the bar image for 
    the first window is used.  
    [TIMOB-7613](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-7613)
     
-   Opening a normal window after a modal window causes the normal window to 
    be reopened when the modal window is closed.
