## About This Release

Titanium Mobile SDK Release 2.1.2 is a service pack release of the Titanium Mobile SDK, including
bug fixes for high-priority issues occurring in Releases 2.1.0 and 2.1.1. This includes fixes for
the Android and iOS platforms, and an updated version of the Ti.Cloud module.

**Note**: Changes to the way the Ti.Cloud module handles authentication may require changes to your 
application. See [Ti.Cloud Module Fixes and Enhancements](#cloud) for details.

## Known Issues

During testing for this release, the following issue was discovered. 

*   Windows 7: Packaging fails for Android modules
    ([TIMOB-10726](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-10726)).

    This issue has been reproduced with Titanium SDK 2.1.1 and 2.1.2. The workaround is 
    to manually create the `build/docs` folder in the module project directory.

## Note on OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) and Xcode 4.4

The Titanium Mobile SDK has been tested with OS X Mountain Lion (10.8). To develop 
iOS apps on 10.8, you must upgrade to Xcode 4.4. Xcode 4.4 is also supported on OS X
Lion (10.7).

When using Xcode 4.4,  note the following known issues:

*   Xcode does not function as expected when installed on a partition other than the boot
    parition ([TIMOB-10360](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-10360)).

*   A warning is generated when launching the simulator 
    ([TIMOB-10243](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-10243)). The warning reads:

        dyld: DYLD_ environment variables being ignored because main executable (/usr/bin/osascript) is code signed with entitlements

    This warning can be safely ignored. It will be fixed in a subsequent release

## Android Fixes and Enhancements

The following section lists all bug fixes and enhancements for the Android
platform.

New Feature:

*   Expose method for controlling selection and cursor in `TextField` and `TextArea` 
    ([TIMOB-6006](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-6006)).
    The new `setSelection` method sets the selection area and cursor position 
    for a text field or text area.

Bug Fixes:

*   Animations don't work with 'dp' values 
    ([TIMOB-9825](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-9825)).

*   App crashes when scrolling a scroll view on Android with 3 fingers 
    ([TIMOB-10452](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-10452)).

*   App intermittently crashes on app restart 
    ([TIMOB-10012](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-10012)).

*   Background services stop when the app is closed via the **Back** button 
    ([TIMOB-9831](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-9831)).

*   `Button`: `touchend` event not fired when `touchmove` gesture moves out of button 
    ([TIMOB-10153](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-10153)).

*   Default project appears with an alert "Restart Required" while launching Android Jelly Bean emulator 
    ([TIMOB-10306](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-10306)).

*   Geolocation: `forwardGeocoder` callback is not called for a bad address 
    ([TIMOB-10309](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-10309)).

*   `HTTPClient`: POST of a Blob or File object leaves behind a temporary file on 
    internal phone storage ([TIMOB-9797](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-9797)).

*   `HTTPClient`: PUT fails for binary Blob or File objects
    ([TIMOB-9590](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-9590)).

*   `HTTPClient`: Uppercase HTTP or HTTPS in URL scheme causes failure 
    ([TIMOB-10350](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-10350)).

*   KitchenSink crashes on relaunch after opening a tab and leaving the device idle for some time 
    ([TIMOB-10227](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-10227)).

*   Map View: Annotations with the same title cannot be uniquely selected. The first is always selected 
    ([TIMOB-10296](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-10296)).

*   Map View `selectAnnotation` parity with iOS 
    ([TIMOB-10009](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-10009)). In previous releases, 
    `selectAnnotation` centered the view exactly on the annotation's coordinates. On very
    small maps, this can result in cutting off the top of the annotation.  With this fix, 
    the map center is adjusted to show the annotation.

*   Message "An application restart is required" fires incorrectly 
    ([TIMOB-9285](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-9285)).
    This fix provides a new workaround for Android bug 2373. This fix supersedes previous
    fixes for this issue, and has been tested with Android versions 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x. For
    complete details on the fix, see JIRA issue.

    To use the new fix, add the following property to `tiapp.xml`:

        <property name="ti.android.bug2373.finishfalseroot" type="bool">true</property>

    Make sure that the `tiapp.xml` file doesn't include any other `ti.android.bug2373`
    properties.

*   `ScrollView` not scrolling with horizontal layout 
    ([TIMOB-9966](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-9966)).

*   `ScrollableView`: `addView` method not working 
    ([TIMOB-9423](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-9423)).
    This method was already supported on iOS. A parity bug is open for Mobile Web
    ([TIMOB-10723](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-10723)).

*   `Switch`: Values of switches added to a `TableView` get changed while scrolling 
    ([TIMOB-9795](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-9795)).

*   `Ti.UI.SIZE` does not work well with nested views 
    ([TIMOB-10003](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-10003)).

*   Timers leak memory ([TIMOB-10351](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-10351)).
    This issue prevented the callback functions passed to `setTimeout` and
    `setInterval` from being garbage collected.

*   `View`: vertical layout does not respect the `bottom` value when padding views 
    ([TIMOB-10175](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-10175)).

## iOS Fixes and Enhancements

The following section lists all bug fixes and enhancements for the iOS platform.

New Feature:

*   Allow setting base iOS SDK version in `tiapp.xml`
    ([TIMOB-2999](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-2999)). With this fix, the
    minimum SDK version can be set by adding text like this to the `tiapp.xml` file:

        <ios>
            <min-ios-ver>5.0</min-ios-ver>
        </ios>

    This prevents the application from launching on devices running an iOS version earlier
    than the specified version (in this case, 5.0).

    **NOTE**: If you use the `transport.py` script to export your application as a generic
    Xcode project, the `min-ios-ver` property is **not** applied to generated project--you
    must set the minimum version directly through Xcode in this case.

*   Geolocation: Expose iOS `startMonitoringSignificantLocationChanges` method 
    ([TIMOB-10041](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-10041)).  
    This new feature adds the ability to receive location updates on significant location changes 
    only, greatly reducing battery usage. Enable this feature by setting the 
    [trackSignificantLocationChange](https://titaniumsdk.com/api/) 
    property to `true`.

Bug Fixes:

*   Camera overlay rendering issues 
    ([TIMOB-10354](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-10354)).

*   Debugger: The `this` variable does not occur in variables view in the Studio debugger 
    ([TIMOB-9636](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-9636)).

*   Map View: Annotation image cannot be changed dynamically 
    ([TIMOB-10203](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-10203)).

*   Map View: Annotations caret is offset from pin top and overlaps pin top 
    ([TIMOB-10220](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-10220)).

*   Networking: Allow network activity indicator to be hidden 
    ([TIMOB-9841](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-9841)).

*   Picker: `setSelectedRow` on picker not working if window is not open 
    ([TIMOB-10146](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-10146)).

*   Precompiled headers modified error 
    ([TIMOB-8025](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-8025)).

*   Refactored Kitchen Sink crashes randomly on start 
    ([TIMOB-10236](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-10236)).

*   TableView: Add `scrollsToTop` property 
    ([TIMOB-10052](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-10052)). When using multiple table 
    views in a single page, this feature allows the developer to specify which tableview scrolls 
    to the top of the screen when the status bar is tapped.

*   TextField: Focusing text fields based on 'return' bounces the keyboard 
    ([TIMOB-10356](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-10356)).

## Ti.Cloud and Ti.CloudPush Module Fixes and Enhancements

This release includes a new version of the `ti.cloud` module, version 2.3.0, and a new
version of the `ti.cloudpush` module, version 2.0.7. New features and fixes in this release include:

*   For improved security, the Ti.Cloud module **no longer persists user login data**. The application can
    persist this data in its own secure storage, if desired. If you do not change your
    application, the user will be required to login each time the application restarts.

    The data that the application must store depends on the type of authentication in use.
    
    *   If using 2-legged OAuth or access key authentication, you must store and restore 
        the [sessionId](https://titaniumsdk.com/api/) value. 
    
    *   If using 3-legged OAuth, introduced in this release, you must store and restore the 
        [accessToken](https://titaniumsdk.com/api/) value. Unlike session IDs, access
        tokens expire after a set period of time. After the access token expires, the user
        will need to reauthenticate. The
        [expiresIn](https://titaniumsdk.com/api/) 
        property is set when a secure login succeeds, and gives the lifespan of the new access token, in seconds.

*   The Ti.Cloud module now supports secure login and secure user creation using 3-legged
    OAuth. For more information, see:
    
    *   [Users.secureCreate](https://titaniumsdk.com/api/) 

    *   [Users.secureLogin](https://titaniumsdk.com/api/)

*   The Ti.CloudPush module fixes an issue where badge numbers were not displayed on
    Android 4.x devices.
