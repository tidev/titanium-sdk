Please see the updated [Titanium Mobile Reference Documentation for 1.6.2](/apidoc/mobile/1.6.2) 

Full list of Issues that were addressed in 1.6.2 

iOS Changes
-----------
We addressed a few issues, including:

- iOS: Push Notifications causing rejections. [TIMOB-3595](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-3595) Apple changed their screening process for App Store submissions for iOS. If a binary contains the call for registering for push notifications, it must include an entitlement resource.  The 1.6.2 SDK for iOS checks to see if the API is used and if it's not, strips out the push notification registration call so it can pass review.
- iOS: Remote Streaming 2 - no spinner is invoked on load [TIMOB-2743](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-2743) The spinner should be properly invoked when loading for remote streaming.
