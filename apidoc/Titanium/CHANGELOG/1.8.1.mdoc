Full list of Issues that were addressed in 1.8.1


Significant Changes In Titanium Mobile
--------------------------------------

- As of Release 1.8.0.1, Xcode 3.2.6 is no longer supported. This was documented in
  the Titanium Compatibility Matrix, but mistakenly omitted from the release notes.


Known Issues
------------

The following are known issues in Release 1.8.1: 

- Android: TableViewRow memory leak. [TIMOB-4367](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-4367)

- Android: Memory leak for proxies that have no references. [TIMOB-7409](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-7409)

We are actively working on fixes for these issues, and plan to have fixes available in the
continuous integration (CI) build in the next week.

Android Changes
---------------

The following sections list notable new features and bug fixes in Android.

*New Feature*

-   Support for using a `Ti.Blob` object to set the `Ti.Map.Annotation.image` property. [TIMOB-6967](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-6967)

    This feature is also supported on iOS.

*Bug Fixes:*

-   V8: Enable 3rd party module build for Windows. [TIMOB-6685](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-6685)
   
    Note that some additional software installs may be required. See 
    [Requirements for Building Android Modules on Windows](#android_modules), below.

-   UI - heavyweight window open event fired twice. [TIMOB-6816](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-6816)

-   MapView not updating regions. [TIMOB-2104](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-2104)`

iOS Changes
-----------

The following sections list notable new features and bug fixes in iOS.

*New Features*

 -  Support for using a `Ti.Blob` object to set the `Ti.Map.Annotation.image` property. [TIMOB-6895](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-6895)

    This feature is also supported on Android.

 -  Support for repeating backgrounds on a view. [TIMOB-4690](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-4690)

    Setting `backgroundRepeat` to `true` causes the view's background image to be tiled.
    This feature is currently only supported on iOS, and will be added to other platforms in
    subsequent releases.

 -  Support for getting current latitude and longitude delta from a MapView. [TIMOB-6831](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-6831)
  
    This feature allows the application to determine the current zoom level of the map view. This 
    feature is currently only supported on iOS, and will be added to other platforms in
    subsequent releases.

 -  Support for disabling animation when setting the `contentOffset` on a scroll view.
  
    To set the content offset for a scroll view without animation, pass a dictionary
    object as the second argument, with the `animated` property set to `false`:

        myScrollView.setContentOffset(newOffset, { animated: false } });

    This feature is only relevant to iOS, since Android and Mobile Web do not support
    animated scrolling.


*Bug Fixes:*

 -  Database migration fixes. [TIMOB-6756](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-6756)

 -  Databases not symlinked on install. [TIMOB-6081](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-6081)

 -  Two module fixes:

     -  Native JS modules detected by compiler. [TIMOB-5815](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-5815) 

     -  Modules not building on Lion. [TIMOB-7001](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-7001)

    If you are working on iOS modules, see 
    [Updating Native JS Modules for iOS](#ios_modules) to see if these fixes apply to you.

 -  Two fixes to HTTP header handling:

    -   A regression in 1.8.0.1 that caused an exception to be thrown when setting a request
        header to `null`. [TIMOB-6828](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-6828)

    -   The `getResponseHeader` method incorrectly used a case-sensitive match on response header names.
        [TIMOB-6832](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-6832)

Requirements for Building Android Modules on Windows
----------------------------------------------------

Building Android modules on Windows requires the following:

- Android Native Development Kit (NDK) r7.

- gperf ([http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gperf.htm](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gperf.htm))

- Ant ([http://ant.apache.org/](http://ant.apache.org/))

- `ant` and `gperf` must be in the user's path.

Updating Native JavaScript Modules for iOS
------------------------------------------

You may need to update your iOS modules if either of the following applies to you:

- You are working on OS X Lion. Modules created prior to this release did not build on
  Lion with Titanium Mobile 1.8.0.1.

- You have a native iOS module that includes JavaScript code which uses Titanium APIs. 
  Due to the issue described in [TIMOB-5815](https://jira-archive.titaniumsdk.com/TIMOB-5815),
  applicatons using your module may fail to compile if the module references APIs not
  used by the application. 


If either of the above conditions apply,  you should update your module's `build.py` file 
and rebuild your module. 

1. Download the `build.py` patch file from: https://gist.github.com/1586163

2. From the top-level directory of your module project, run this command to 
   patch your `build.py` file:

       patch -p4 *<downloaded_file_path>*/build.py.patch

3. Rebuild your module with `build.py`.


Note that new modules created with release 1.8.1 do not need to 
be patched.
