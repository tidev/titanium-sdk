name: Titanium.Android.BigPictureStyle
summary: Helper object for generating large-format notifications that include a large image attachment.
description: |
    If the platform does not provide large-format notifications, this style helper has no effect.
    The user will always see the normal notification view.

    This style object attaches to a <Titanium.UI.Notification> object and modifies its behavior.
examples:
  - title: Big picture style Example
    example: |
        This example will be use image that placed in one of the density-specific folder
        under `Resources/android/images`

        ``` js
        var bigPictureStyle = Titanium.Android.createBigPictureStyle({
            bigPicture: "/images/bigPicture.png",
            bigContentTitle: "Title for big picture",
            summaryText: "Summary for big picture"
        });
        ```

        Create big image style notification

        ``` js
        var notification = Titanium.Android.createNotification({
            contentTitle: 'Something Happened',
            contentText : 'Click to return to the application.',
            style: bigPictureStyle,
            time: Date.now()
        });
        ```

properties:

  - name: bigLargeIcon
    summary: Override the <Titanium.Android.Notification.largeIcon> when the big notification is shown.
    description: |
        If specified as a URL, the icon must be placed in one of the density-specific
        folders under `Resources/android/images`. For example, if your icon is called
        `my_big_large_icon.png`, you would create high- and medium-density versions of the icons
        with the following paths:

        ```
        Resources/android/images/res-hdpi/my_big_large_icon.png
        Resources/android/images/res-mdpi/my_big_large_icon.png
        ```

        To access this icon, you'd use the URL '/images/my_big_large_icon.png'.

        To access the same icon using an Android resource ID, place the icon in:

        ```
        platform/android/res/drawable/my_big_large_icon.png
        ```

        This icon's resource ID can be referenced through the <Titanium.App.Android.R>
        object:

        ``` js
        icon: Ti.App.Android.R.drawable.my_big_large_icon,
        ```

        See <Titanium.App.Android.R> for more information on accessing
        Android resources by ID.
    type: [Number, String]

  - name: bigPicture
    summary: Provide the bitmap to be used as the payload for the BigPicture notification.
    description: |
        Image to display, defined using a local filesystem path, a `File` object, a remote URL,
        or a `Blob` object containing image data.

        If there is a redirect and change in protocol, it will not follow. For example,
        from http to https and vice versa. See [Java Bug Database](https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4620571)
        for more information.

        If specified as a local URL, the bigPicture must be placed in one of the density-specific
        folders under `Resources/android/images`. For example, if your bigPicture is called
        `my_big_picture.png`, you would create high- and medium-density versions of the bigPicture
        with the following paths:

        ```
        Resources/android/images/res-hdpi/my_big_picture.png
        Resources/android/images/res-mdpi/my_big_picture.png
        ```

        To access this bigPicture, you'd use the URL '/images/my_big_picture.png'.

        To access the same bigPicture using an Android resource ID, place the bigPicture in:

        ```
        platform/android/res/drawable/my_big_picture.png
        ```

        This bigPicture's resource ID can be referenced through the <Titanium.App.Android.R>
        object:

        ``` js
        bigPicture: Ti.App.Android.R.drawable.my_big_picture,
        ```

        See <Titanium.App.Android.R> for more information on accessing
        Android resources by ID.
