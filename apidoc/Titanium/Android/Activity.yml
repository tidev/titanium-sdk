name: Titanium.Android.Activity
summary: The Titanium binding of an Android Activity.
description: |
    According to the Android API Reference, an activity is "a single, focused thing that a
    user can do."

    In almost all cases, an activity is associated with a window.  Activities are central
    to the Android **Back** button navigation -- the **Back** button closes the current
    activity and returns to whatever activity was open previously.

    In Titanium, the Android Activity is not created until a window or tab group is opened.
    After a Window or TabGroup object is created but before it is opened, its `activity` property
    refers to an empty JavaScript object. You can use it to set properties on the activity, such as
    the `onCreateOptionsMenu` property, but you cannot invoke any Activity methods.

    After the window or tab group opens, a real Activity object is created and the properties from
    the JavaScript object are copied over. The `activity` property now refers to this real Activity object,
    which you can use to call the various Activity methods. For example, to use the
    `invalidateOptionsMenu` method, you need to get the activity after the window or tab group opens.

    See also [android.app.Activity](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html)
    in the Android API Reference.

    #### Activity Lifecycle

    In Android, activities are created, started, resumed, paused, stopped, destroyed and restarted.
    Titanium generates lifecycle events for activities but does not generate application-level events.
    To be notified when an activity's lifecycle event is triggered, assign callbacks to the following activity
    properties:

      * [onCreate](Titanium.Android.Activity.onCreate)
      * [onStart](Titanium.Android.Activity.onStart)
      * [onResume](Titanium.Android.Activity.onResume)
      * [onPause](Titanium.Android.Activity.onPause)
      * [onStop](Titanium.Android.Activity.onStop)
      * [onDestroy](Titanium.Android.Activity.onDestroy)
      * [onRestart](Titanium.Android.Activity.onRestart)

    See also the "Understand the Lifecycle Callbacks" section in
    [Android Developers: Activity Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/activity-lifecycle/starting.html).

    #### Don't keep activities option

    Android 4.0 and greater devices have an option called **Don't keep activities** under the **Developer
    Options** menu. When this option is enabled, the Android OS will destroy an activity as soon as it
    is stopped. It is intended to help developers debug their apps. For example, it can simulate the
    case that Android will kill an activity in the background due to memory pressure. In
    normal use, it is not recommended to turn this option on because this may lead to unexpected issues
    on the apps, such as freezes, force closes and reboots.

    When the **Don't keep activities** option is enabled, the lifecycle of the activity is different
    from the normal case. Whenever the user leaves an activity, such as backgrounding the app using the
    HOME button, this activity is destroyed by Android, which calls `onDestroy`.  In the normal case, `onStop`
    would be called and the activity would not be destroyed.  Later, when the user goes back to that activity, this
    activity will be recreated, which calls `onCreate`.  In the normal case, since the activity is not destroyed, 
    `onRestart` would be called instead.  Therefore, some events, such as the open and close events on the Window
    or TabGroup, will be fired differently from the normal case, and the root window of the app must set
    [exitOnClose](Titanium.UI.Window.exitOnClose) to true; otherwise, the app will be unable to back out, that is,
    hitting the BACK button in the root window will not allow the application to exit.

    #### Deprecated Behavior

    Prior to Release 8.0.0, you would set the below "tiapp.xml" property to `true` to handle the case
    where the Android OS would automatically close all child activity windows after the app has been backgrounded
    for about 30 minutes, bringing the app back to the root splash screen activity window. The below property
    would restart your app's UI in this case. This is no longer needed in 8.0.0 since Titanium now sets the
    "AndroidManifest.xml" setting
    [android:alwaysRetainTaskState](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element#always)
    to the root activity instead

    ``` xml
    <property name="ti.android.root.reappears.restart" type="bool">true</property>
    ```

    Prior to Release 3.4.0, to monitor lifecycle events, use the activity's events, `create`, `destroy`,
    `pause`, `resume`, `start` and `stop`, to be notified when an activity is created, destroyed, paused,
    resumed, started and stopped, respectively.

    You can only set Activity properties from a TabGroup object after the tab group opens.

    Prior to Release 3.2.0, you can create either a "lightweight" or "heavyweight" window, as
    described on the <Titanium.UI.Window> reference page. A *heavyweight* window creates a 
    new `Activity`. A *lightweight* window runs inside the same activity as the code that
    created it.  If you try to reference the activity of lightweight window, it returns undefined.

        ``` js
        Ti.Android.currentActivity.getString(Ti.App.Android.R.string.greeting,  "Bob", "Doug" );

  - name: userinteraction
    summary: Called whenever a key, touch, or trackball event is dispatched to the activity.
    description: |
        Implement this method if you wish to know that the user has interacted with the device in some 
        way while your activity is running. This event and `userleavehint` are intended to help activities 
        manage status bar notifications intelligently; specifically, for helping activities determine the 
        proper time to cancel a notfication.

        All calls to your activity's "userleavehint" event will be accompanied by calls to "userinteraction".
        This ensures that your activity will be told of relevant user activity such as pulling down the 
        notification pane and touching an item there.

        Note that this callback will be invoked for the touch down action that begins a touch gesture, 
        but may not be invoked for the touch-moved and touch-up actions that follow.
