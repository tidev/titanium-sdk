name: Titanium.Android.Activity
summary: The Titanium binding of an Android Activity.
description: |
    According to the Android API Reference, an activity is "a single, focused thing that a
    user can do."

    In almost all cases, an activity is associated with a window.  Activities are central
    to the Android **Back** button navigation -- the **Back** button closes the current
    activity and returns to whatever activity was open previously.

    In Titanium, you can create either "lightweight" or a "heavyweight" windows, as
    described on the <Titanium.UI.Window> reference page. A *heavyweight* window creates a 
    new `Activity`. A *lightweight* window runs inside the same activity as the code that
    created it. 

    The activity is not created until the window is opened. When a window is created,
    its `activity` property refers to an empty JavaScript object.
    You can use it, for example, to add an options menu by setting `onCreateOptionsMenu`.
    After the window is opened, a real Activity object is created and the properties from
    the JavaScript object are copied over.
    The `activity` property now refers to this real Activity object,
    which you can use to call the various Activity methods. For example, to use the
    `invalidateOptionsMenu` method, you need to get the activity proxy after the window is opened.

    See: [android.app.Activity](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html)
    in the Android API Reference.

    #### Activity Lifecycle

    In Android, activities are started, stopped, paused and resumed. Titanium generates
    lifecycle events for activities, but doesn't generate application-level start, stop, 
    pause and resume events. To be notified when
    an application is paused and resumed, you must add event listeners to its individual
    activities.

    Android 4.0 and greater devices have an option called **Don't keep activities** under the **Developer
    Options** menu. When this option is enabled, the Android OS will destroy an activity as soon as it
    is stopped. It is intended to help developers debug their apps. For example, it can simulate the
    case that Android will kill an activity in the background due to memory pressure. In
    normal use, it is not recommended to turn this option on because this may lead to unexpected issues
    on the apps, such as freezes, force closes and reboots.

    When the **Don't keep activities** option is enabled, the lifecycle of the activity is different
    from the normal case. Whenever the user leaves an activity, such as backgrounding the app using the
    HOME button, this activity is destroyed by Android, which calls `onDestroy`.  In the normal case, `onStop`
    would be called and the activity would not be destroyed.  Later, when the user goes back to that activity, this
    activity will be recreated, which calls `onCreate`.  In the normal case, since the activity is not destroyed, 
    `onRestart` would be called instead.  Therefore, some events, such as the open and close events on the Window
    or TabGroup, will be fired differently from the normal case, and the root window of the app must set
    [exitOnClose](Titanium.UI.Window.exitOnClose) to true; otherwise, the app will be unable to back out, that is,
    hitting the BACK button in the root window will not allow the application to exit.

methods:
  - name: finish
    summary: Closes this activity.

  - name: getString
    summary: Gets an Android or Application string using the specified Resource ID and optional format arguments. 
    description: |
        If the optional format arguments are supplied, these are substituted for the
        corresponding format specifiers in the string. For example, given the following
        string resource:

            <string name="greeting">"Hello %1$s, this is %2$s."</string>

        You could call `getString` like this:

            Ti.Android.currentActivity.getString(Ti.App.Android.R.string.greeting,  "Bob", "Doug" );

        The resulting string is:

            "Hello Bob, this is Doug."
