name: Titanium.Android
summary: The top-level Android module.
description: |
    The Android module allows the application to manage various Android components.

    #### Drawer Layout

    The drawer-layout components acts as a top-level container for window content that allows
    for interactive "drawer" views to be pulled out from one or both vertical edges of the window.
    It is represented by a `centerView` and optional `leftView` and `rightView` components that
    can be swiped in and out with additional configuration and transitions. Learn more about
    drawer-layouts in it's dedicated <Titanium.UI.Android.DrawerLayout> docs.

    #### Action Bar

    An action bar is a UI feature that identifies the application and user location, and
    provides user actions and navigation modes.

    The Titanium SDK lets you customize the look of the action bar and add action items.
    Action items are added using the <Titanium.Android.Menu> API.

    For more information about the action bar, see the
    [Titanium.Android.ActionBar API reference](Titanium.Android.ActionBar).

    #### Activities

    An Android application is made up of one or more activities. Each activity represents a single screen
    with a user interface.

    In Titanium, each `Window` or `TabGroup` has its own activity. The application
    can access the activity of a `Window` and `TabGroup` object and monitor its lifecycle events.
    Titanium also lets you launch new activities by creating intents to launch them.
    See the "Intents" section below.

    For more information about activities, see the
    [Titanium.Android.Activity API reference](Titanium.Android.Activity).

    #### Broadcast Intents and Receivers

    Broadcast Intents allow your application to send out a message to any application that sets up
    a Broadcast Receiver to listen to it. Your application can also register Broadcast Receivers
    to listen to system events sent by the Android OS, such as low battery warnings or airplane
    mode changes.

    For more information about broadcasts, see the
    [Android Broadcast Intents and Receivers guide](https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/Android_Broadcast_Intents_and_Receivers)
    and [Titanium.Android.BroadcastReceiver API reference](Titanium.Android.BroadcastReceiver).

    #### Intents

    Intents are message objects that specify actions to perform which can start either activities,
    broadcasts or services.

    For more information about intents, see the
    [Titanium.Android.Intent API reference](Titanium.Android.Intent).

    #### Intent Filters

    Intent Filters advertise to the Android OS that your application handles certain actions and
    data types. For example, when another application wants to share an image or text, your application
    can define intent filters to let Android know your application can handle those data types.

    For more information about intent filters, see the
    [Android Intent Filters guide](https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/Android_Intent_Filters).

    #### Notifications

    Notifications alert the user that something is happening to your application while it is
    in the background. Notifications appear in the notification drawer until the user
    clears them and on the lock screen for devices running Android 5.0 or greater.
    Note that the user can filter or turn notifications on and off from **Settings**.
    For more information about notifications, see the
    [Titanium.Android.Notification API reference](Titanium.Android.Notification).

    For Android toast notifications (pop-up notifications sent while the application is in the
    foreground), see <Titanium.UI.Notification>.

    #### Options Menu

    The options menu is a feature of older Android devices (prior to Android 3.0 (API 11)), and has been
    replaced by the action bar. The options menu is accessed by pressing the **Menu** and presents
    a pop-up menu of options the user can execute.

    The `Titanium.Android.Menu` API is used to construct both the options menu and action items for
    the action bar.

    For more information about the options menu, see the
    [Titanium.Android.Menu API reference](Titanium.Android.Menu).

    #### Services

    A service is a component started by an application that runs in the background. The service
    does not have any application UI associated with it, so the user does not directly interact
    with it, only your application.

    The Titanium SDK gives you the ability to write your own Android Services using JavaScript.
    The service executes your JavaScript code at intervals you specify. Note that the service
    will stop running when you back out of the app. So, if you want the service to continue running,
    then it's recommended that you set the root window's [exitOnClose](Titanium.UI.Window.exitOnClose)
    property to `false` so that the window will persist in the background like iOS.

    For more information about services, see the
    [Titanium.Android.Service API reference](Titanium.Android.Service).

    #### Permissions

    Starting from Android 6.0 (API level 23), users need to grant certain permissions to apps while the
    app is running. You can read it more [here](https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting.html).

    In Titanium SDK, to support this, we have the <Titanium.Android.requestPermissions> method. It is used to
    request any permission you may need. An example of using it is shown below:

    ``` js
    var permissions = [ 'android.permission.CAMERA', 'android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE', 'android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE' ];
    Ti.Android.requestPermissions(permissions, function (e) {
        if (e.success) {
            Ti.API.info('SUCCESS');
        } else {
            Ti.API.info('ERROR: ' + e.error);
        }
    });
    ```

methods:
  - name: createIntentChooser
    summary: |
        Creates an activity chooser intent, used to allow the user to select a target activity
        for an intent.
    description: |
        Use this method when the user wants to take an action that could use any one of a
        number of applications. For example, when sending a plain text message, the user
        may choose to send a text message, send an email, or post to a social network.

        You pass in an [Intent](Titanium.Android.Intent) representing the action being taken,
        and a title for the chooser.

        The method returns another intent, representing the chooser, which can be used to
        start an activity. See the code example for details on how to display the chooser.

        For more information, see the official Android documentation for
        [Intent.ACTION_CHOOSER](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#ACTION_CHOOSER)
