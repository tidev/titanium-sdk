summary: The Titanium binding of an Android Action Bar.

    According to the Android API Reference, an action bar is a window feature that identifies
    the application and user location, and provides user actions and navigation modes.  This
    feature is only available in Android 3.0 (API level 11) and above.

    To access the action bar, you must first open a heavyweight window or tab group that
    uses one of the action bar themes (such as the Android Holo theme). You can then
    access the action bar from the window or tab group's [activity](Titanium.Android.Activity). 

    You can add action items to the action bar by defining an Android menu and setting the
    menu items to display as action items. See [Menu](Titanium.Android.Menu) and
    [MenuItem](Titanium.Android.MenuItem) for details.

    See: [Action Bar](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/actionbar.html)
    in the Android API Reference.

  - title: Action Bar Example
    example: |
        The following example sets several properties on a window's action bar.

            var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
                title: "Old Title",
                navBarHidden: false
            });
            var actionBar;
    
            win.addEventListener("open", function() {
                if (Ti.Platform.osname === "android") {
                    if (! win.activity) {
                        Ti.API.error("Can't access action bar on a lightweight window.");
                    } else {
                        actionBar = win.activity.actionBar;
                        if (actionBar) {
                            actionBar.backgroundImage = "/bg.png";
                            actionBar.title = "New Title";
                            actionBar.onHomeIconItemSelected = function() {
                                Ti.API.info("Home icon clicked!");
                            };
                        }
                    }
                }
            });
    
            win.open();

        Nearly identical code can be used for a tab group, but in Release 3.0, the tab group's
        activity must be accessed using the [getActivity](Titanium.UI.TabGroup.getActivity) method.
