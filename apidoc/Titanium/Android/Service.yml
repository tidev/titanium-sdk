name: Titanium.Android.Service
summary: The Titanium binding of an [Android Service](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service.html).  Can be used to start/stop the service directly and listen for service-specific events.  In the Javascript-based services you write, this can be referenced with <Titanium.Android.currentService>.  You can create an instance of the service with <Titanium.Android.createService>.
extends: Titanium.Proxy
platforms: [android]
since: "1.5"
methods:
  - name: start
    summary: Start the Service.  Effective only if this instance of <Titanium.Android.Service> was created with <Titanium.Android.createService>.
  - name: stop
    summary: Stop this running instance of the Service.
events:
  - name: pause
    summary: For Javascript-based Services which you create, `pause` fires after each time the Javascript code executes.  `resume` and `pause` happen in pairs, with `resume` firing just before your Javascript service code executes, and `pause` just after.
    properties:
      - name: iteration
        summary: incrementing integer indicating which iteration of an interval-based Service is pausing.  For example, if you have an interval-based Service running every 10 seconds, iteration 3 would occur at about 30 seconds after you start the instance (assuming your service code runs quickly).
  - name: resume
    summary: For Javascript-based Services which you create, `resume` fires each time the Javascript code executes.  For example, if your Service runs on an interval of 10000 (10 seconds), you would expect to see `resume` fired every 10 seconds, just as the Javascript service code you wrote is about to execute.
    properties:
      - name: iteration
        summary: incrementing integer indicating which iteration of an interval-based Service is resuming.  For example, if you have an interval-based Service running every 10 seconds, iteration 3 would occur at about 30 seconds after you start the instance (assuming your service code runs quickly).
  - name: start
    summary: Fired when the bound Service instance starts.  Bound service instances are created via <Titanium.Android.createService>.
  - name: stop
    summary: Fired when the bound Service instance stops, meaning <Titanium.Android.Service.stop> or <Titanium.Android.stopService> has been called and there are no more bound, un-stopped clients.
properties:
  - name: intent
    summary: The <Titanium.Android.Intent> used to start or bind to the Service.
    type: Titanium.Android.Intent
    permission: read-only
  - name: serviceInstanceId
    summary: A service can be started more than once -- this number (based on an incrementing integer) indicates which "start number" in the sequence the current service instance is.
    type: Number
    permission: read-only
examples:
  - title: Hello World Service
    example: |

        Your service code in its own Javascript file.  It reads the <Titanium.Android.Intent> which created it, to see what it should say besides "Hello World".

        File: myservice.js:

            var service = Titanium.Android.currentService;
            var intent = service.intent;
            var message = intent.getStringExtra("message_to_echo");
            Titanium.API.info("Hello World!  I am a Service.  I have this to say: " + message);

        Register the service in tiapp.xml:

            <android xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
                <services>
                    <service url="myservice.js" type="interval"/>
                </services>
            </android>

        Code in "regular" Titanium file to launch the service and listen for pause/resume events.  Code also stops the service after its code runs 3 times.

            var intent = Titanium.Android.createServiceIntent( { url: 'myservice.js' } );
            // Service should run its code every 2 seconds.
            intent.putExtra('interval', 2000);
            // A message that the service should 'echo'
            intent.putExtra('message_to_echo', 'Titanium rocks!');

            var service = Titanium.Android.createService(intent);
            service.addEventListener('resume', function(e) {
                Titanium.API.info('Service code resumes, iteration ' + e.iteration);
            });
            service.addEventListener('pause', function(e) {
                Titanium.API.info('Service code pauses, iteration ' + e.iteration);
                if (e.iteration === 3) {
                    Titanium.API.info('Service code has run 3 times, will now stop it.');
                    service.stop();
                }
            });
            service.start();
