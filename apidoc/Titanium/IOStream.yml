methods:

  - name: read
    summary: Reads data from this stream into a buffer.
    description: |
        Takes an optional `resultsCallback` function as the last argument. If specified,
        the operation is done asynchronously. If no callback is passed in, the
        operation is done synchronously.

        If `offset` and `length` are specified, data is written into the buffer starting at
        position `offset`. Data is read from this stream until one of the following occurs:

        *   the end of this stream is reached
        *   the end of the buffer is reached
        *   a total of `length` bytes have been read from the stream

        If `offset` and `length` are omitted, data is written starting at the beginning
        of the buffer.

        When called synchronously: returns the number of bytes read, or -1 if the end of
        stream was reached before any data was read.

        Returns 0 when called asynchronously.

        Throws an exception on error. For example, if the `offset` value is past
        the last byte of `buffer`.

    returns:
        type: Number
        summary: Number of bytes read.
    parameters:
      - name: buffer
        summary: Buffer to read stream data into.
        type: Titanium.Buffer

      - name: offset
        summary: |
            Offset into the buffer to start writing stream data.
            If specified, `length` must also be specified.
        type: Number
        optional: true
        default: 0

      - name: length
        summary: |
            Maximum number of bytes to read.
            If specified, `offset` must also be specified.
        type: Number
        optional: true
        default: Length of the supplied buffer.

      - name: resultsCallback
        summary: Function to call with the results of the read operation.
        type: Callback<ReadCallbackArgs>
        optional: true

  - name: write
    summary: Writes data from a buffer to this stream.
    description: |
        Takes an optional `resultsCallback` function as the last argument. If specified,
        the operation is done asynchronously. If no callback is passed in, the
        operation is done synchronously.

        If `offset` and `length` are specified, data is read from the buffer starting at
        `offset`. Bytes are read from the buffer and written to the stream until:

        * the end of the buffer is reached
        * `length` bytes have been written
        * the stream returns an error

        If `offset` and `length` are omitted, all of the data in the buffer is written to
        this stream.

        Returns the number of bytes actually written when called synchronously.

        Returns 0 when called asynchronously.

        Throws an exception if an error is encountered.
    returns:
        type: Number
        summary: Number of bytes written.
    parameters:
      - name: buffer
        summary: Buffer to write to this stream.
        type: Titanium.Buffer

      - name: offset
        summary: |
            Offset in the buffer of the first byte to write to the stream.
            If specified, `length` must also be specified.
        type: Number
        optional: true
        default: 0

      - name: length
        summary: |
            Maximum number of bytes to write to the stream.
            If specified, `offset` must also be specified.
        type: Number
        optional: true
        default: Length of the supplied buffer.

      - name: resultsCallback
        summary: Function to call with the results of the write operation.
        type: Callback<WriteCallbackArgs>
        optional: true

  - name: isWritable
    summary: Indicates whether this stream is writable.
    returns:
        type: Boolean
        summary: True if stream is writable, false otherwise.

  - name: isReadable
    summary: Indicates whether this stream is readable.
    returns:
        type: Boolean
        summary: True if stream is readable, false otherwise.

  - name: close
    summary: Closes this stream.

examples:
  - title: Write Data to a Stream
    example: |
        This example demonstrates writing data to a stream.

        ``` js
        var outBuffer = Ti.createBuffer({data: "write me"});
        // stream object could be socket, file, buffer or blob
        var outStream = Ti.Stream.createStream({mode: Ti.Stream.MODE_WRITE});

        var bytesWritten = outStream.write(outBuffer);  // writes entire buffer to stream
        Ti.API.info("Bytes written:" + bytesWritten);  // should be 8

        bytesWritten = outStream.write(outBuffer, 2, 5);  // only writes "ite m" to stream
        Ti.API.info("Bytes written:" + bytesWritten);  // should be 5
        ```

  - title: Read Data From a Stream
    example: |
        This shows a simple example of reading data from a stream, one buffer full at a
        time.

        ``` js
        var size = 0;
        // read data one buffer full at a time
        while ((size = instream.read(buffer)) > -1) {
            // do something with the data here ...
            Ti.API.info("Read " + size + " bytes.");
        }
        ```

  - title: Read Data With Offset and Length
    example: |
        This example shows how to read data from a stream into a buffer. We assume that
        the `inStream` variable holds a previously initialized stream that contains the
        string, "World Titanium".

        ``` js
        var inBuffer = Ti.createBuffer({ value: "Hello [           ]" });

        // Read the first 6 bytes from the stream to the buffer, starting at position 10.
        var bytesRead = inStream.read(inBuffer, 10, 6);

        Ti.API.info("Bytes read: " + bytesRead);
        Ti.API.info(inBuffer.toString());

        // Read the next 8  bytes from the stream to the buffer, starting at position 8.
        bytesRead = inStream.read(inBuffer, 8, 8);

        Ti.API.info("Bytes read: " + bytesRead);
        Ti.API.info(inBuffer.toString());
        ```

        The second `read` overwrites the data from the first `read`, so the output looks
        like this:

        ```
        [INFO] Bytes read: 6
        [INFO] Hello [   World   ]
        [INFO] Bytes read: 8
        [INFO] Hello [ Titanium  ]
        ```
