name: Titanium.Buffer
summary: Buffer is a mutable, resizable container for raw data.
description: |
    A `Buffer` works like a resizable array of byte values.

    Use the <Titanium.createBuffer> method to create a buffer.
extends: Titanium.Proxy

platforms: [android, iphone, ipad, macos]
properties:
  - name: length
    type: Number
    summary: Length of the buffer in bytes.
    description: |
        When `length` is modified the buffer will be re-sized while preserving existing data where
        possible. If the new buffer length is smaller than the length of the existing data then the
        existing data will be truncated down to the size of the new buffer.

        Resizing a buffer by setting its length should be used sparingly due to the associated overhead.
    default: 0 unless `value` is specified, in which case the length of the encoded data
        is used.

  - name: value
    type: [Number, String]
    availability: creation
    summary: Data to be encoded.
    description: |
        If `value` is a Number, `type` must also be set. (This is simply a convenient way of
        calling <Titanium.Codec.encodeString> or <Titanium.Codec.encodeNumber>.)

  - name:  type
    type: String
    availability: creation
    summary: The type of data encoding to use with `value`.
    description: |
        Required when `value` is a Number. For numbers, specify a `TYPE` constant
        from <Titanium.Codec>, for example, <Titanium.Codec.TYPE_DOUBLE>.

        When `value` is a String, specify a `CHARSET` constant from <Titanium.Codec>.
    default: For string values, defaults to <Titanium.Codec.CHARSET_UTF8>.

  - name: byteOrder
    type: Number
    availability: creation
    summary: Byte order of this buffer.
    description: |
        Specify either <Titanium.Codec.BIG_ENDIAN> or <Titanium.Codec.LITTLE_ENDIAN>.
    default: OS native byte order.

        from `sourceBuffer`.

        If `sourceOffset` and `sourceLength` are specified, bytes are copied from

        If `offset` and `length` are specified, creates a new buffer from the original
        buffer contents starting at `offset` and ending at `offset`+`length`-1.
