name: Titanium.Buffer
description: Buffer is a container for raw data. A buffer is created by the method `Titanium.createBuffer`.
extends: Titanium.Proxy
since: "1.7"
platforms: [android, iphone, ipad]

properties:
  - name: length
    type: Number
    description: The length of the buffer in bytes. When `length` is modified the buffer will be re-sized while preserving existing data where possible. If the new buffer length is smaller than the length of the existing data then the existing data will be truncated down to the size of the new buffer.  Resizing the buffer via setting length should be used sparingly due to the associated overhead.
    default: 0, unless `value` is specified, at which case the length of the encoded data is used
  - name: value
    type: [Number, String]
    availability: creation
    description: Data to be encoded. If `value` is a Number, `type` must also be set. (this is simply a convenient way of calling <Titanium.Codec.encodeString> or <Titanium.Codec.encodeNumber>).
  - name:  type
    type: String
    availability: creation
    description: The type of data encoding to use with `value`. Required when `value` is a Number. When `value` is a String, <Titanium.Codec.CHARSET_UTF8> is the default.
  - name: byteOrder
    type: Number
    availability: creation
    description: The byte order of this buffer. The OS native byte order is used by default.

methods:
  - name: append
    returns:
        type: Number
        description: The number of bytes appended.
    description: appends `sourceBuffer` to the current buffer.  Buffer is grown dynamically to accommodate the additional data if need be.
    parameters:
      - name: sourceBuffer
        description: buffer to append to current buffer
        type: Titanium.Buffer
  - name: append
    returns:
        type: Number
        description: The number of bytes appended.
    description: same as normal append except this allows appending only `sourceLength` bytes from the `sourceBuffer` starting at `sourceOffset`.

        type: Number
  - name: insert
    returns:
        type: Number
        description: The number of bytes inserted.
    description: inserts `sourceBuffer` into the current buffer at `offset`.  Buffer is grown to accommodate the new data.
    parameters:
      - name: sourceBuffer
        description: buffer to insert into current buffer
        type: Titanium.Buffer
      - name: offset
        description: offset to insert new buffer at
        type: Number

    returns:
        type: Number
        description: The number of bytes inserted.
    description: inserts `sourceLength` amount of data starting at `sourceOffset` from `sourceBuffer` into current buffer at `offset`.  Buffer is grown to accommodate the new data.

  - name: copy
    returns:
        type: Number
        description: The number of bytes copied.
    description: copies the contents of `sourceBuffer` into the current buffer at `offset`.  will not expand buffer if there is not enough room in the current buffer to accomodate all the requested data from `sourceBuffer`.

        type: Number
        description: The number of bytes copied.
    description: copies `sourceLength` contents from `sourceBuffer` starting at `sourceOffset` into the current buffer at `offset`.  will not expand buffer if there is not enough room in the current buffer to accomodate all the request data from `sourceBuffer`.
