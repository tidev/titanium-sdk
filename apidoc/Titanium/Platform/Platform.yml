  - name: id
    summary: Applications's globally-unique ID (UUID).
    description: |
        On Android, this may be the UDID (unique device ID). For iOS, this

        Previously on iOS this may have been a UDID, but access to
        this has been restricted by Apple. For more information, see
        [UUID Article on NSHipster](http://nshipster.com/uuid-udid-unique-identifier/)
        documentation.

        To use a UUID across different applications of the same vendor,
        use <Titanium.Platform.identifierForVendor> instead.

        To use a UUID for tracking / advertising purposes,
        use <Titanium.Platform.identifierForAdvertising> instead.

  - name: identifierForVendor
    summary: An alphanumeric string that uniquely identifies a device to the app's vendor.
    description: |
        The value of this property is the same for apps that come from the same
        vendor running on the same device. A different value is returned for apps
        on the same device that come from different vendors, and for apps on
        different devices regardless of vendor. See the [Apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uidevice/1620059-identifierforvendor) for more infos.

  - name: identifierForAdvertising
    summary: An alphanumeric string unique to each device, used only for serving advertisements.
    description: |
        Unlike the <Titanium.Platform.identifierForVendor> property, the same
        value is returned to all vendors. This identifier may change, for example,
        if the user erases the device, so you should not cache it.

        In iOS 10.0 and later, the value of this property is all zeroes when the
        user has limited ad tracking.

        If the value is `null`, wait and get the value again later. This happens,
        for example, after the device has been restarted but before the user has
        unlocked the device.
    type: String
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
    since: "7.0.0"

  - name: isAdvertisingTrackingEnabled
    summary: A Boolean value that indicates whether the user has limited ad tracking.
    description: |
        Check the value of this property before performing any advertising tracking.

        purposes: frequency capping, attribution, conversion events, estimating the
        number of unique users, advertising fraud detection, and debugging.
