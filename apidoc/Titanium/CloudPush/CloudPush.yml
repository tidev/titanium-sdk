    Provides support for Android push notifications.
description: |
    The CloudPush module supports Android push notifications for a device by providing a connection
    to the push notification server to the device to receive push notifications and to optionally
    present a tray notification to the user when a new push notification is received.

    This module is only used to receive push notifications.  For information on configuring your
    project to send push notifications, see <Titanium.Cloud.PushNotifications>.

    #### Push Protocols

    The CloudPush module supports two protocols to access push notifications for Android devices:

      * Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) (since Release 3.1.2)
      * ACS servers using the MQTT protocol

    Since Release 3.1.2, GCM is the default method to send push notifications. If you
    have an existing application that uses the MQTT protocol, you either need to transition your
    application to use GCM or set the `acs-push-type` key in the `tiapp.xml` file to `mqtt`.

    GCM supports devices that run Android 2.2 and later, and requires that the Google Play Store
    application be installed. For pre-4.0 devices, the user is required to set up their Google
    account.

    GCM is available for both the community edition of the Titanium platform and the paid,
    enterprise version of the Appcelerator Platform.

    MQTT is a light-weight protocol that provides a persistent connection to the ACS server without
    significantly degrading the device's battery life.  MQTT does not have any specific device
    requirements.  MQTT is only available for the community edition of the Titanium platform.

    #### Getting Started

    To use the CloudPush module in your JavaScript code, you need to require it in,
    initialize it with the `retrieveDeviceToken` method, then enable push notifications.
    In your project's `tiapp.xml`, you need to add some keys to configure push notifications.

    Note that this module is not included in the Titanium namespace, but it is bundled with the Titanium SDK as of
    version 2.0.0. To use it, you must require it, like this:

        var CloudPush = require('ti.cloudpush');

    Then, call the `retrieveDeviceToken` method before setting the `enabled` property to `true`
    to enable the device to receive push notifications. You must call `retrieveDeviceToken` before
    any other CloudPush API call or else the device will not receive push notifications.

    This module must also be added to the modules section in your tiapp.xml. This can be done using the Modules list in
    the Titanium Studio TiApp Editor, or by editing the XML directly and adding the following line to the modules
    element:

        <module platform="android">ti.cloudpush</module>

    Your app must prove that it is allowed to talk to ACS. This keeps your data secure by preventing anyone from
    making requests to ACS that impersonate your app.

    Titanium Studio creates a pair of keys (Development and Production) for each Titanium application depending on the
    user preference specified during new project creation. This pair of keys will be stored in `tiapp.xml` and one of the
    keys will be used during application build depending on the build type (development or production).

    To use push notifications, in the `tiapp.xml` file, you need to specify the ACS keys and push type
    (either `gcm` or `mqtt`). The supported properties in `tiapp.xml` are:

        <!-- Property keys for ACS (required) -->
        <property name="acs-api-key-development" type="string">YOUR DEVELOPMENT API KEY HERE</property>
        <property name="acs-api-key-production" type="string">YOUR PRODUCTION API KEY HERE</property>
        <property name="acs-api-key" type="string">YOUR API KEY HERE</property>

        <!-- Property to configure push notifications -->
        <!-- By default, GCM is used if this property is not specified -->
        <property name="acs-push-type-development" type="string">"gcm" or "mqtt"</property>
        <property name="acs-push-type-production" type="string">"gcm" or "mqtt"</property>
        <property name="acs-push-type" type="string">"gcm" or "mqtt"</property>

    If a deployment-specific setting is provided (production or development) then that value will be used for the current deployment environment.

    *WARNING*: The default properties of this module are used until you set a property for the first time. Because the
    properties are persisted to the device settings (via <Titanium.App.Properties>), the most recent value you set will
    always be used.

extends: Titanium.Module
methods:
  - name: retrieveDeviceToken
    summary: Asynchronously retrieves the application specific device token.
    description: |
        This token is used in calls to the Appcelerator Cloud Service's subscribe or unsubscribe to push notification
        channels. This token is unique to each application and device.
    parameters:
      - name: config
        summary: Dictionary specifying token retrieval related options. 
        type: CloudPushNotificationConfig

  - name: clearStatus
    summary: Clears the CloudPush module's stored status, including the push type, device token, GCM sender ID, etc.
    description: |
        This method is useful to transfer the push type from MQTT to GCM, or changing the GCM sender ID when needed.
        After calling this method, the CloudPush module is reinitialized. Use `retrieveDeviceToken` to
        get the device token again.
    since: 3.1.2
properties:
  - name: enabled
    summary: Whether or not this device will receive push notifications.
    description: |
        You must ask your users before enabling this. Note that once enabled, the application will be able to receive
        notifications at any time, even after the device reboots, regardless of if your application has been run
        recently or not. But if the user intentionally kills your application and its services in their task manager,
        push notifications will be disabled and this property will automatically be set to false.
        
        Also be aware that whenever your application is updated (through the market or through ADB installing a new
        APK), the push service will be stopped until the app is launched for the first time.
        
        Listen for this module's [callback](Titanium.CloudPush.callback) event to receive push notifications once this
        property is set to true.
    type: Boolean
    default: false
  - name: showTrayNotification
    summary: Whether or not to show a tray notification when a new push is received.
    description: |
        If your payload is only a string, it will be used as the contentText and tickerText, and your application's name
        will be used as the contentTitle with a system icon.
        
        Note that in your payload, you can customize this tray notification using any of the properties of a
        <Titanium.Android.Notification>, except for contentIntent and deleteIntent (those are automatically set).
    type: Boolean
    default: true
  - name: showAppOnTrayClick
    summary: Whether or not clicking the tray notification will bring your application to the foreground.
    description: |
        This is only applicable if you have set [showTrayNotification](Titanium.CloudPush.showTrayNotification) to true.
    type: Boolean
    default: true
  - name: showTrayNotificationsWhenFocused
    summary: Whether or not to show tray notifications when your application is in the foreground.
    description: |
        Instead of showing a notification, the [callback](Titanium.CloudPush.callback) event will be immediately fired
        instead.
        
        This is only applicable if you have set [showTrayNotification](Titanium.CloudPush.showTrayNotification) to true.
    type: Boolean
    default: false
  - name: focusAppOnPush
    summary: Whether or not your application is brought to the foreground whenever a new push is received.
    description: |
        Note that this behavior is rather disruptive to users, and is strongly discouraged.
    type: Boolean
    default: false
  - name: singleCallback
    summary: Set to true to trigger a single callback for the selected push notification when multiple push notifications are displayed in the tray.
    description: |
        In previous versions of the module, clicking on one of the application's push notifications triggered the callbacks for all of the application's push notifications.
        The new module retains the same behavior by default.
        
        Set this property to true to receive a single callback for the push notification selected by the user, regardless of how many push notifications are displayed in the tray.
    type: Boolean
    default: false
events:
  - name: trayClickLaunchedApp
    summary: Fired when a tray notification is shown and the application is not running.
    description: |
        Touching it launches the app, and fires this event.
        
        This is only applicable if you have set [showTrayNotification](Titanium.CloudPush.showTrayNotification) to true.
  - name: trayClickFocusedApp
    summary: Fired when a tray notification is shown and the application is already running.
    description: |
        Touching it focuses the app, and fires this event.
        
        This is only applicable if you have set [showTrayNotification](Titanium.CloudPush.showTrayNotification) to true.
  - name: callback
    summary: Fired whenever a push notification is received.
    description: |
        If your application is not running when a push is received, the push will be saved in a queue until the next
        time you add an event listener for this.

        This will only be fired once per push notification.

        This event will be fired at different times depending on your settings and the application's present state
        (foreground, background, or not running at all). When [focusAppOnPush](Titanium.CloudPush.focusAppOnPush) is true, this
        will fire as soon as you receive a push. When [showTrayNotification](Titanium.CloudPush.showTrayNotification) is true, this
        will fire as soon as the user touches the tray notification to focus your application. Or, if
        [showTrayNotificationsWhenFocused](Titanium.CloudPush.showTrayNotificationsWhenFocused) is false, and your application is
        in the foreground, it will be called right away. If both [focusAppOnPush](Titanium.CloudPush.focusAppOnPush)
        and [showTrayNotification](Titanium.CloudPush.showTrayNotification) are false, this will fire the next time your
        application is launched and you add an event listener for it.

        You can use the [trayClickLaunchedApp](Titanium.CloudPush.trayClickLaunchedApp) and
        [trayClickFocusedApp](Titanium.CloudPush.trayClickFocusedApp) events to distinguish between the various ways
        a push notification can return a user to your application.
