    returns:
        type: Boolean
    platforms: [blackberry]

properties:
  - name: portrait
    summary: Indicates whether current window is considered portrait by the device.
    description: |
        Value is `true` if in portrait, and `false` otherwise. 
        
        On iOS, use [isPortrait](Titanium.Gesture.isPortrait).
    type: Boolean
    accessors: false

    platforms: [android, mobileweb, tizen]

  - name: landscape
    summary: Indicates whether current window is considered landscape by the device.
    description: |
        Value is `true` if in landscape, and `false` otherwise. 
        
        On iOS, use [isLandscape](Titanium.Gesture.isLandscape).
    type: Boolean

    platforms: [android, mobileweb, tizen]

  - name: orientation
    summary: Orientation of the current window.  
    description: |
        Value may be one of the group of <Titanium.UI> orientation constants, 
        <Titanium.UI.PORTRAIT>, 
        <Titanium.UI.UPSIDE_PORTRAIT>, 
        <Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_LEFT>, 
        <Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_RIGHT>, 
        <Titanium.UI.FACE_UP>, 
        <Titanium.UI.FACE_DOWN>, 
        or <Titanium.UI.UNKNOWN>. 
        
        On iOS, returns the current orientation of the *device*, regardless of the screen
        orientation. To determine the current screen orientation on iOS, use 
        <Titanium.UI.orientation>. 
        
        On Android, Mobile Web and Tizen, returns the orientation of the current window, and never reports 
        the "reverse" orientations (`LANDSCAPE_RIGHT` and `UPSIDE_PORTRAIT`). 
        
        For Mobile Web and Tizen, the orientation reported by `Gesture.orientation` and 
        [Window.orientation](Titanium.UI.Window.orientation) is always the same, and corresponds to 
        the orientation of the browser window. 
        
        To set the *allowable* orientations for a window, see <Titanium.UI.Window.orientationModes>.

events:
  - name: orientationchange
    summary: Fired when the device orientation changes.
    description: |
        On Android, note that the application must have a heavyweight window or tab group open 
        in order to receive the `orientationchange` event. It is not necessary for the  heavyweight
        window to be the topmost window.
        
        Almost all real-world applications will have a heavyweight window or a tab group. This is 
        only likely to be an issue if you create a test case or test application that adds an 
        orientation change listener from `app.js` without opening a heavyweight window. 
        
        Android, Mobile Web and Tizen do not report the "reverse" orientations,
        `UPSIDE_PORTRAIT` and `LANDSCAPE_RIGHT`. These are reported as 
        `PORTRAIT` and `LANDSCAPE_LEFT`, respectively. 
    properties:
      - name: orientation
        summary: |
            Orientation of the current window.  
            Value will be one of the group of <Titanium.UI> orientation constants, 
            <Titanium.UI.PORTRAIT>, 
            <Titanium.UI.UPSIDE_PORTRAIT>, 
            <Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_LEFT>, 
            <Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_RIGHT>, 
            <Titanium.UI.FACE_UP>, 
            <Titanium.UI.FACE_DOWN>, 
            or <Titanium.UI.UNKNOWN>.
        type: Number

  - name: shake
    summary: Fired when the device is shaken.
    description: |
        A shake gesture consists of a series of quick accelerations, and is represented by a series
        of shake events. 
        
        The `timestamp` property represents the interval between shake events. It is measured in 
        milliseconds on Android, Mobile Web and Tizen, and in seconds on iOS. 
        
        Note that Mobile Web and Tizen detect shake gestures using the device accelerometer, if the device 
        and browser support this. This event cannot be generated on Mobile Web and Tizen in the iOS simulator. 
        The simulator's **Shake Gesture** menu item generates a native shake event, but does not 
        generate accelerometer events to the browser.
    properties:

      - name: timestamp
        summary: |
            Time interval since previous shake event. On iOS, this value is 0 for the first shake 
            event in a series.
        type: Number

      - name: x
        summary: Acceleration along the X axis, in Gs.
        type: Number
        
      - name: y
        summary: Acceleration along the Y axis, in Gs.
        type: Number

      - name: z
        summary: Acceleration along the Z axis, in Gs.
        type: Number
