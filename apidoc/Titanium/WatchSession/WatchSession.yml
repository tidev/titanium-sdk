  - title: Creating a Watch Session
    example: |
        The following example demonstrates how to create a new watch session, and call methods to transfer
        data to the watch. Also include event listeners for receiving data from the watch.
        
        It is important to note that this only works if there is a corresponding watchOS app written
        in Objective-C / Swift in the Xcode project inside the extensions folder of the Titanium Project.
        
        #### app.js
        ``` js        
        Ti.WatchSession.activateSession();

        var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
            backgroundColor: 'white'
        });

        var eventsArea = Ti.UI.createTextArea({
          borderWidth: 2,
          borderColor: '#bbb',
          borderRadius: 5,
          color: '#888',
          font: {fontSize:16},
          textAlign: 'left',
          value: 'This is where we listen for events',
          bottom: 10,
          width: 300, height : 140
        });

        win.add(eventsArea);

        var imageView = Ti.UI.createImageView ({
            top: 240,
            width: 80,
            height: 80
        });

        win.add(imageView);

        var statusBtn = Ti.UI.createButton({
            title: 'status me',
            top: 40
        });

        statusBtn.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
            eventsArea.value += '\nbtn pressed '
            + '\nwatchOS is supported: ' + Ti.WatchSession.isSupported
            + '\nwatch is paired: ' + Ti.WatchSession.isPaired
