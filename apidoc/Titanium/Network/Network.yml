summary: The top level network module.  
description: |
    The `Network` module is used to access networking related functionality.

    For TCP sockets, see <Titanium.Network.Socket.TCP>.

    The legacy <Titanium.Network.TCPSocket> object is still required
    by the [BonjourBrowser](Titanium.Network.BonjourBrowser) and
    [BonjourService](Titanium.Network.BonjourService) objects.

    For all other socket needs, use <Titanium.Network.Socket.TCP>.
