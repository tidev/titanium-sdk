name: Titanium.Network.Socket.TCP
summary: TCP socket that implements the `Titanium.IOStream` interface.
description: |
    Most socket operations are asynchronous. When you create a socket, you can define
    callback functions to receive the results of API calls, as well as to handle incoming
    data.

    For example, for a client-side socket, you define
    [connected](Titanium.Network.Socket.TCP.connected) and
    [error](Titanium.Network.Socket.TCP.error) callback functions.

    To connect to a remote host, call the socket's
    [connect](Titanium.Network.Socket.TCP.connect) method. If the socket connects
    successfully, your `connected` callback is invoked, and you can send and receive data
    on the socket. If the socket connection fails, your `error` callback is invoked.

    After a socket is connected, you can access it like any other <Titanium.IOStream>.
    Note that the socket's `read` and `write` methods may block, so in most cases
    you should use the asynchronous [read](Titanium.Stream.read), [write](Titanium.Stream.write)
    and [pump](Titanium.Stream.pump) methods provided by the <Titanium.Stream> module,
    rather than using the socket object's `read` and `write` methods directly.

    A familiarity with the basics of BSD socket programming is recommended before using
    sockets with Titanium.

    Use the <Titanium.Network.Socket.createTCP> method to create a TCP socket.

examples:
  - title: Simple Socket IO using Stream.pump
    example: |
        The following example uses the [pump](Titanium.Stream.pump) method from the <Titanium.Stream>
        module to read data from a socket. The `pump` method registers a callback that is
        called repeatedly to process incoming data from the socket.

        ``` js
        var socket = Ti.Network.Socket.createTCP({
            host: 'blog.example.com', port: 80,
            connected: function (e) {
                Ti.API.info('Socket opened!');
                Ti.Stream.pump(e.socket, readCallback, 1024, true);
                Ti.Stream.write(socket, Ti.createBuffer({
                    value: 'GET http://blog.example.com/index.html HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n'
                }), writeCallback);
            },
                error: function (e) {
                Ti.API.info('Error (' + e.errorCode + '): ' + e.error);
            },
        });
        socket.connect();

        function writeCallback(e) {
            Ti.API.info('Successfully wrote to socket.');
        }

        function readCallback(e) {
            if (e.bytesProcessed == -1)
            {
                // Error / EOF on socket. Do any cleanup here.
                ...
            }
            try {
                if(e.buffer) {
                    var received = e.buffer.toString();
                    Ti.API.info('Received: ' + received);
                } else {
                    Ti.API.error('Error: read callback called with no buffer!');
                }
            } catch (ex) {
                Ti.API.error(ex);
            }
        }
        ```

  - title: Listening Socket Example
    example: |
        The following sample shows a trivial example of using a listening
        socket. In this case, the application simply sends messages to itself,
        using the loopback address.

        ``` js
        // Hostname to listen on/connect to. Here we use the loopback
        // address. iOS also supports Ti.Platform.address (the address of
        // the WiFi interface).
        // Android supports only the loopback address.

        var hostname = '127.0.0.1';

        var clientSocket = Ti.Network.Socket.createTCP({
            host : hostname,
            port : 40404,
            connected : function(e) {
                Ti.API.info('Client socket connected!');
                Ti.Stream.pump(e.socket, pumpCallback, 1024, true);
                e.socket.write(Ti.createBuffer({
                    value : 'A message from a connecting socket.'
                }));
            },
            error : function(e) {
                Ti.API.info('Error (' + e.errorCode + '): ' + e.error);
            }
        });

        function writeCallback(e) {
            Ti.API.info('Successfully wrote to socket.');
        }

        function pumpCallback(e) {
            // Has the remote socket closed its end?
            if (e.bytesProcessed < 0) {
                Ti.API.info("Closing client socket.");
                clientSocket.close();
                return;
            }
            try {
                if(e.buffer) {
                    var received = e.buffer.toString();
                    Ti.API.info('Received: ' + received);
                } else {
                    Ti.API.error('Error: read callback called with no buffer!');
                }
            } catch (ex) {
                Ti.API.error(ex);
            }
        }

        // Create a socket and listen for incoming connections
        var listenSocket = Ti.Network.Socket.createTCP({
            host : hostname,
            port : 40404,
            accepted : function(e) {
                // This where you would usually store the newly-connected socket, e.inbound
                // so it can be used for read / write operations elsewhere in the app.
                // In this case, we simply send a message then close the socket.
                Ti.API.info("Listening socket <" + e.socket + "> accepted incoming connection <" + e.inbound + ">");
                e.inbound.write(Ti.createBuffer({
                    value : 'You have been connected to a listening socket.\r\n'
                }));
                e.inbound.close();
                // close the accepted socket

            },
            error : function(e) {
                Ti.API.error("Socket <" + e.socket + "> encountered error when listening");
                Ti.API.error(" error code <" + e.errorCode + ">");
                Ti.API.error(" error description <" + e.error + ">");
            }
        });
        // Starts the socket listening for connections, does not accept them
        listenSocket.listen();
        Ti.API.info("Listening now...");

        // Tells socket to accept the next inbound connection. listenSocket.accepted gets
        // called when a connection is accepted via accept()
        Ti.API.info("Calling accept.");
        listenSocket.accept({
            timeout : 10000
        });

        // Call connect after a short timeout to ensure the listening socket is ready to go.
        Ti.API.info("Setting timer to connect.");
        setTimeout(function(e)
        {
            Ti.API.info("Calling connect on client socket.");
            clientSocket.connect();
        }, 500);

                 Titanium.Network.Socket.ERROR ]

methods:
  - name: connect
    summary: Attempts to connect the socket to its host/port.
    description: |
        Throws an exception if the socket is in a [CONNECTED](Titanium.Network.Socket.CONNECTED)
        or [LISTENING](Titanium.Network.Socket.LISTENING) state.
        Throws an exception if a valid host and port has not been set on this socket.

        Nonblocking; connection attempts are asynchronous.

  - name: listen
    summary: Attempts to start listening on the socket's host/port.
    description: |
        The `listen` call will attempt to listen on the specified host and/or port
        property for the socket if they are set.

        Nonblocking; may return before the socket is fully open and listening.

        If the socket is already in a [LISTENING](Titanium.Network.Socket.LISTENING) or
        [CONNECTED](Titanium.Network.Socket.CONNECTED) state, `listen` throws an exception
        and sets the socket state to [ERROR](Titanium.Network.Socket.ERROR), but does
        **not** fire the error callback.

        Any error encountered after the socket starts listening results in the error
        callback being fired.

  - name: accept
    summary: Tells a [LISTENING](Titanium.Network.Socket.LISTENING) socket to accept a connection request at the top of a listener's request queue when one becomes available.
    description: |
        Nonblocking; if there are no connections in the queue, sets a flag so that
        the socket accepts the next incoming connection immediately.

        Takes an argument, an <AcceptDict> object which assigns options to the new
        connection.  If the socket is already flagged to accept the next connection,
        the existing accept options will be updated to use the newly specified `options`
        object.

        The `accepted` callback is called when a new connection is accepted as a result of
        calling `accept`. The callback argument holds a reference to a new socket,
        representing the accepted connection.

        Note that the connected callback is **not** called on the newly created socket.
        This is because the socket is created in the
        [CONNECTED](Titanium.Network.Socket.CONNECTED) state, so it never transitions
        to the `CONNECTED` state.

        Throws an exception if called on a socket that is not in a
        [LISTENING](Titanium.Network.Socket.LISTENING) state.
    parameters:
      - name: options
        summary: Options to be set on next accepted socket.
        type: AcceptDict

  - name: close
    summary: Closes a socket.
    description: |
        Throws exception if the socket is not in a [CONNECTED](Titanium.Network.Socket.CONNECTED)
        or [LISTENING](Titanium.Network.Socket.LISTENING) state. Blocking.
