name: Titanium.Network.BonjourService
summary: Describes a service on the network which is published by Bonjour.
description: |
    You can obtain a `BonjourService` instance by calling <Titanium.Network.createBonjourService> 
    or from the `service` list from a [BonjourBrowser](Titanium.Network.BonjourBrowser)  
    `updatedservices` event.   

    You can only publish Bonjour services attached to a socket which is currently listening; 
    you cannot publish a service for a remotely connected socket.  If you stop the Bonjour 
    service and wish to close the socket it uses, it is strongly recommended that you stop 
    the service first.  When a window which publishes a Bonjour service is closed, you must 
    stop the service if the associated socket is also to be closed, or if it is no longer 
    necessary to publish.  Bonjour service resolution and publishing is asynchronous.

examples:
  - title: Resolve local HTTP/TCP services
    example: |
        The following code excerpt looks for http-based TCP zeroconf services on the local network.
        It then attempts to resolve the service, establishing a socket that can be used for communications.

        ``` js
        // Create the Bonjour Browser (looking for http)
        var httpBonjourBrowser = Ti.Network.createBonjourBrowser({
          serviceType: '_http._tcp',
          domain: 'local'
        });

        // Handle updated services
        httpBonjourBrowser.addEventListener('updatedservices', function (e) {
          for (var service of e.services) {
              // callback style
              service.resolve(120, (err, success) => {
                  console.log(service.socket);
                  console.log(service.socket.port);
                  console.log(service.socket.host);
              });
          }
        });

        // Start searching
        httpBonjourBrowser.search();
        ```

  - title: Create and Publish a local HTTP/TCP service
    example: |
        The following code excerpt creates a zeroconf bonjour service and publishes it out to the local network.
        A TCP Socket is used to handle listening for clients and communicating.

        ``` js
        // Create the Bonjour Service
        var localService = Ti.Network.createBonjourService({
          name: 'example',
          type: '_test._tcp',
          domain: 'local.'
        });

        // Create the socket we'll tie to the service
        var bonjourSocket = Ti.Network.Socket.createTCP({
          host: '127.0.0.1',
          port: 40401,
          accepted: function (e) {
            // Here you handle clients connecting
            Ti.API.info("Listening socket <" + e.socket + "> accepted incoming connection <" + e.inbound + ">");
            e.inbound.write(Ti.createBuffer({
              value: 'You have been connected to a listening socket.\r\n'
            }));
            e.inbound.close();
          },
          error: function (e) {
            // handle errors...
            Ti.API.error("Socket <" + e.socket + "> encountered error when listening");
            Ti.API.error(" error code <" + e.errorCode + ">");
            Ti.API.error(" error description <" + e.error + ">");
          }
        });

        // Make the socket listen for connections
        bonjourSocket.listen();

        // Make the socket accept incoming connections
        bonjourSocket.accept({ timeout: 10000 });

        // Publish the service
        localService.publish(bonjourSocket, fnction (err, bool) {
          // Now you can find the service on your network (including using a Ti.Network.BonjourBrowser)
        });
        ```
