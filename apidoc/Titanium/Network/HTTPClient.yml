name: Titanium.Network.HTTPClient
summary: HTTP client object that (mostly) implements the XMLHttpRequest specification.
description: |
    Use <Titanium.Network.createHTTPClient> to create a new `HTTPClient` object.
    
    An `HTTPClient` object is intended to be used for a single request. It may be 
    possible to re-use an `HTTPClient` object, but this use case is not tested. 
    
    There are three steps in making a typical HTTP request:
    
    * Creating an `HTTPClient` object.
    * Opening the `HTTPClient` object.
    * Sending the request.
    
    Before opening the request, you must define one or more callbacks to handle
    the HTTP response, as well as errors, progress updates, and other conditions.
    
    The `HTTPClient` callbacks operate somewhat differently from other
    Titanium callbacks, in accordance with the XMLHttpRequest specification.
    
    When the callbacks are invoked, the `this` value is set to either the 
    original `HTTPClient` object itself, or a response object that holds all
    of the response-related properties defined for the `HTTPClient` object. So the 
    callbacks can use code like this to access the response values:
    
        httpResponse = this.responseText;
        status = this.status;
    
    #### Mobile Web Platform Implementation Notes
    
    Mobile Web is limited by the same-origin policy. According to W3C: "User agents 
    commonly apply same-origin restrictions to network requests. These restrictions 
    prevent a client-side Web application running from one origin from obtaining 
    data retrieved from another origin, and also limit unsafe HTTP requests that can 
    be automatically launched toward destinations that differ from the running 
    application's origin."  This means that browsers cannot request information from 
    a domain that the app itself does not reside on. If you are hosting the app at 
    foo.example.com, then requests to any domain other than *.example.com will fail.
    
    There are two solutions to get around this problem:
    
    * Configure the destination server to support Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
    * Use [Ti.Network.httpURLFormatter](Titanium.Network.httpURLFormatter) in conjunction 
      with a proxy on the server hosting the application.
    
    More information about Cross-Origin Resource Sharing can be found on the 
    [W3C Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) specification page.

        type: String
    
  - name: open
    summary: Opens the request and prepares the connection.
    parameters:
      - name: method
        summary: HTTP method for this request, such as 'GET' or 'POST'.
        type: String
        
      - name: url
        summary: URL for the request.
        type: String
        
      - name: async
        summary: Determines whether the request should be made asynchronously. Only used on iOS and Mobile Web.
        type: Boolean
        optional: true
        default: true
    
  - name: send
    summary: Sends the request.
    description: |
        For POST requests, use the `data` parameter to send POST data.
        
        If you pass a serializable JavaScript object, it is automatically turned into form-encoded 
        POST data. You can also send an arbitrary string or binary data (in the form of a 
        <Titanium.Blob>).
        
        On iOS, you can specify a synchronous request when you call `open` by passing `false` for 
        the `async` parameter. In the case of a synchronous request, `send` blocks until the request 
        is complete.
    parameters:
      - name: data
        summary: Data to send with a POST request. 
        type: [Object, String, Titanium.Filesystem.File, Titanium.Blob]

        type: String

            X-Requested-With.

        the five `Titanium.Network.HTTPClient` ready state constants. A typical HTTP request goes 
        through the states in this order:
        
        * [UNSENT](Titanium.Network.HTTPClient.UNSENT)
        * [OPENED](Titanium.Network.HTTPClient.OPENED)
        * [HEADERS_RECEIVED](Titanium.Network.HTTPClient.HEADERS_RECEIVED)
        * [LOADING](Titanium.Network.HTTPClient.LOADING) 
        * [DONE](Titanium.Network.HTTPClient.DONE)
        
        The `onreadystatechange` callback is invoked each time the ready state changes.

    summary: Response data as a `Blob` object.
    type: Titanium.Blob
    permission: read-only

    summary: Response as text.
    description: Set to `null` if an error was received or no data was returned.
    type: String
    permission: read-only
    
  - name: responseXML
    summary: Response object as an XML DOM Document object. 
    description: 
       Set to `null` if the content type returned by the server was not XML or if the content could 
       not be parsed.
    type: Titanium.XML.Document
    permission: read-only

    summary: Response HTTP status code.

  - name: statusText
    summary: Human-readable status message associated with the status code.
    type: String
    permission: read-only
    
  - name: timeout
    summary: Timeout in milliseconds when the connection should be aborted.
    description: |
        On Mobile Web, the timeout only works when making asynchronous requests.
    type: Number
    
  - name: validatesSecureCertificate
    summary: Determines how SSL certification validation is performed on connection.  
    description: Note that on iOS, this value is always `false` by default. This is a known issue.
    type: Boolean
    default: |
        False when running in the simulator or on device in testing mode, and true if built for 
        release in distribution mode.
    platforms: [android, iphone, ipad]
    
  - name: withCredentials
    summary: |
        Determines whether the request should include any cookies and HTTP authentication information.
    description: |
        Set to `true` to include cookies and HTTP authentication information with the request. 
        
        This property must be set before open() is called. Setting this to true will force the 
        request to be asynchronous.
    type: Boolean
    default: false
    platforms: [mobileweb]
    
  - name: tlsVersion
    summary: Sets the TLS version to use for handshakes. 
    description: |
        If you experience handshake failures, set this value to a lower version using the TLS 
        constants in <Titanium.Network>. 'undefined', 'null', or unsupported values use the default 
        behavior for that iOS version.
    default: |
        undefined. For iOS 4, this is effectively 
        [TLS_VERSION_1_0](Titanium.Network.TLS_VERSION_1_0). For iOS 5 and greater, this is 
        [TLS_VERSION_1_2](Titanium.Network.TLS_VERSION_1_2).
    type: Number
    since: "1.8.0"
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
    
  - name: cache
    summary: Determines whether HTTP responses are cached.
    description: |
        If `cache` is set to `true`, requests using this HTTP client will cache their responses 
        (respecting headers such as "no-cache", "no-store", and cache expiry). In this case, repeated 
        requests to the same URL may retrieve the initial response rather than triggering a new 
        request. The cache is shared between all instances of `HTTPClient`.
        
        Caching should only be enabled for HTTP requests which you expect the result to remain 
        consistent for.
        
        If `cache` is `false`, any request on this HTTP client will result in a new HTTP request.
        
        This propery must be set before `open` is called.
    type: Boolean
    since: "1.9.0"
    default: false
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]

examples:
  - title: Simple GET Request
    example: |
        The following code excerpt does a simple GET request and logs the response text.
        
             var url = "http://www.appcelerator.com";
             var client = Ti.Network.createHTTPClient({
                 // function called when the response data is available
                 onload : function(e) {
                     Ti.API.info("Received text: " + this.responseText);
                     alert('success');
                 },
                 // function called when an error occurs, including a timeout
                 onerror : function(e) {
                     Ti.API.debug(e.error);
                     alert('error');
                 },
                 timeout : 5000  // in milliseconds
             });
             // Prepare the connection.
             client.open("GET", url);
             // Send the request.
             client.send();
