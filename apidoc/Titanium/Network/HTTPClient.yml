name: Titanium.Network.HTTPClient
summary: HTTP client object that (mostly) implements the XMLHttpRequest specification.
description: |
    Use <Titanium.Network.createHTTPClient> to create a new `HTTPClient` object.

    An `HTTPClient` object is intended to be used for a single request. It may be
    possible to re-use an `HTTPClient` object, but this use case is not tested.

    There are three steps in making a typical HTTP request:

    * Creating an `HTTPClient` object.
    * Opening the `HTTPClient` object.
    * Sending the request.

    Before opening the request, you must define one or more callbacks to handle
    the HTTP response, as well as errors, progress updates, and other conditions.

    The `HTTPClient` callbacks operate somewhat differently from other
    Titanium callbacks, in accordance with the XMLHttpRequest specification.

    When the callbacks are invoked, the `this` value is set to either the
    original `HTTPClient` object itself, or a response object that holds all
    of the response-related properties defined for the `HTTPClient` object. So the
    callbacks can use code like this to access the response values:

    ``` js
    httpResponse = this.responseText;
    status = this.status;
    ```

    #### Content-Type Header

    When sending a POST request with the HTTP client, the Content-Type header is set automatically
    depending on the platform and data type sent.

    On the Android and iOS platforms:

      * If you are sending a JavaScript object, the content type is set to `multipart/form-data`.
      * For all other data types on Android, the content type is set to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
      * For all other data types on iOS, the content type is **NOT** set.

    Use the [setRequestHeader](Titanium.Network.HTTPClient.setRequestHeader) method to override the
    default Content-Type header.

    #### Asynchronous vs. Synchronous HTTP Requests

    By default, the `HTTPClient` makes asynchronous requests.  Asynchronous requests do not block
    the application and use callbacks to process responses when they are received.

    Synchronous requests block the execution of the application until it receives a response.
    On the iOS platform,  you can make synchronous requests by setting the optional
    `async` parameter to `false` when calling the [open](Titanium.Network.HTTPClient.open) method.

    The Android platform does not support synchronous requests.

    #### TLS Support

    Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a protocol that ensures privacy between communicating applications
    and their users on the Internet. When a server and client communicate, TLS ensures that no third
    party may eavesdrop or tamper with any message. TLS is the successor to the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

    To communicate to servers with the TLS protocol, you need to use the same TLS version between
    the client and server.

    <table class="doc-table" summary="This table provides information about TLS versions.">
      <caption><b>TLS versions by platform</b></caption>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Protocol</th>
          <th>Android</th>
          <th>iOS</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th align="left">TLS 1.0</th>
          <td>1.0+</td>
          <td>1.0+</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th align="left">TLS 1.1</th>
          <td>4.1+</td>
          <td>5.0+</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th align="left">TLS 1.2</th>
          <td>4.1+</td>
          <td>5.0+</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th align="left">TLS 1.3</th>
          <td>10.0+</td>
          <td>12.2+</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    In Titanium, if a connection with TLS 1.2 fails, Titanium will re-attempt the connection with
    TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.0. By default, TLS 1.2 is attempted first.

    Use the <Titanium.Network.HTTPClient.tlsVersion> property to set the version of the TLS protocol
    if you know the version the server is running.  If you do not know, do not set this property.
    Titanium will not fallback with a lower TLS version if the `tlsVersion` property is set.
    Setting the TLS version saves time from re-attempting connections with lower TLS versions and
    provides added security by denying attempts to use lower TLS versions.

    You can set the TLS version for the Android and iOS platforms.
    
    #### Caching Data

    You can also use the HTTP client API to cache image, response data or related. A convenient
    way to do so is by setting the <Titanium.Network.HTTPClient.file> property to a path or target
    file, which will be populated with the response data in a successful case (e.g. in the `onload`
    callback). For more complex use cases, make sure to check [To.ImageCache](https://github.com/Topener/To.ImageCache/)
    which also supports expire-handling and extended cache control.

    #### Android Platform Implementation Notes

    On Android, the `HTTPClient` uses its own cookie store which does not share cookies with the
    system cookie store used by <Titanium.UI.WebView>. Developers can manage their cookies for both
    cookie stores using the methods <Titanium.Network.addHTTPCookie>, <Titanium.Network.addSystemCookie>,
    <Titanium.Network.getHTTPCookies>, <Titanium.Network.getHTTPCookiesForDomain>, <Titanium.Network.getSystemCookies>,
    <Titanium.Network.removeHTTPCookie>, <Titanium.Network.removeHTTPCookiesForDomain>, <Titanium.Network.removeAllHTTPCookies>,
    <Titanium.Network.removeSystemCookie>, <Titanium.Network.removeAllSystemCookies>.

  - name: send
    summary: Sends the request.
    description: |
        For POST requests, use the `data` parameter to send POST data.

        If you pass a serializable JavaScript object, it is automatically turned into form-encoded
        POST data. You can also send an arbitrary string or binary data (in the form of a
        <Titanium.Blob>).

        To send array data, specify each array element individually as a property of the object.
        For example, normally, you specify an array in an object as:

        ``` js
        var payload = { myArray: [1, 2, 3] };
        ```

        Instead, for the HTTP client to encode the data correctly, you need to send the data as:

        ``` js
        var payload = {
            "myArray[0]" : 1,
            "myArray[1]" : 2,
            "myArray[2]" : 3
        };
        ```

        On iOS, you can specify a synchronous request when you call `open` by passing `false` for
        the `async` parameter. In the case of a synchronous request, `send` blocks until the request
        is complete.
    parameters:
      - name: data

    type: Callback<FailureResponse>

  - name: onload
    summary: Function to be called upon a successful response.
    description: |
        Must be set before calling `open`.

        To access response data and headers, access the `HTTPClient` object itself (accessible as

        [LOADING](Titanium.Network.HTTPClient.LOADING),
        or [DONE](Titanium.Network.HTTPClient.DONE).

        Due to the asynchronous nature of the Titanium platform, the internal value of
        [readyState](Titanium.Network.HTTPClient.readyState) might be different from the state change
        for which the event was fired. To address this discrepancy, the function is now invoked with a
        payload object of type <ReadyStatePayload>. This is supported on the iOS and Android platforms.

        (respecting headers such as "no-cache", "no-store", and cache expiry). In this case, repeated
        requests to the same URL may retrieve the initial response rather than triggering a new
        request. The cache is shared between all instances of `HTTPClient`.

        Caching should only be enabled for HTTP requests which you expect the result to remain
        consistent for.

        If `cache` is `false`, any request on this HTTP client will result in a new HTTP request.

        This propery must be set before `open` is called.

name: APSConnectionDelegate
summary: An extension of the [NSURLConnectionDelegate](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Foundation/Reference/NSURLConnectionDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/intf/NSURLConnectionDelegate) protocol to allow users to participate in authentication and resource management for this HTTPClient.
description: |
    The APSConnectionDelegate protocol is an extension of the NSURLConnectionDelegate protocol.

    Although all methods in this protocol are optional, the connection delegate must implement at least one of the methods to
    participate in the authentication and resource management.

    The deprecated methods as defined by the NSURLConnectionDelegate protocol are not supported.

    In addition to the methods defined in the NSURLConnectionDelegate protocol this protocol defines one additional method.

    `-(BOOL)willHandleChallenge:(NSURLAuthenticationChallenge *)challenge forConnection:(NSURLConnection *)connection`.

    This method is called on the connection delegate only if it also implements the
    `connection:willSendRequestForAuthenticationChallenge:` method of the NSURLConnectionDelegate protocol.
    Return `true` if the connection delegate wants to handle this challenge.
    Return `false` if the default delegate will handle this challenge.

    If the connection delegate does not implement this method but implements `connection:willSendRequestForAuthenticationChallenge:`, the return
    value is assumed to be `true` and all challenges will be forwarded to the connection delegate.
