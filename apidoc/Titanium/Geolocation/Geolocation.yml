summary: The top level Geolocation module. The Geolocation module is used for accessing device location based information.
description: |
    This module combines two sets of features:

    *   Location services. Determining the location of the device.

    *   Geocoding and reverse geocoding. Converting geographic  coordinates into
        addresses, and converting addresses into geographic  coordinates.

    Using location services can have a significant impact on a device's battery life,
    so it's important to use them in the most efficient manner possible. Power consumption
    is strongly influenced by the accuracy and frequency of location updates required by
    your application.

    The location services systems of the underlying platforms are very different, so there
    are significant implementation differences between the platforms.

    The basic methods of requesting location information and receiving location updates
    are essentially the same on all platforms. However, the method of configuring the
    accuracy and frequency of location updates is different for each platform.

    #### Getting Location Information

    There are two ways to get location information:

    *   Make a one-time request with [getCurrentPosition](Titanium.Geolocation.getCurrentPosition).

    *   Register to receive location updates by adding an event listener for the
        [location](Titanium.Geolocation.location) event.

    **NOTE:** Location services stay enabled for as long as a listener is registered for the
    `location` event, so be sure to remove the event listener when you do not require
    location updates.

    #### Configurating Location Updates on iOS

    In iOS, the accuracy (and power consumption) of location services is primarily
    determined by the [accuracy](Titanium.Geolocation.accuracy) setting. This can be set
    to one of the following values:

    *   [ACCURACY_BEST](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_BEST) (highest accuracy and power consumption)
    *   [ACCURACY_BEST_FOR_NAVIGATION](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_BEST_FOR_NAVIGATION)
    *   [ACCURACY_HIGH](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_HIGH)
    *   [ACCURACY_NEAREST_TEN_METERS](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_NEAREST_TEN_METERS)
    *   [ACCURACY_HUNDRED_METERS](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_HUNDRED_METERS)
    *   [ACCURACY_KILOMETER](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_KILOMETER)
    *   [ACCURACY_LOW](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_LOW)
    *   [ACCURACY_THREE_KILOMETERS](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_THREE_KILOMETERS) (lowest
        accuracy and power consumption).

    Based on the accuracy you choose, iOS uses its own logic to select location providers
    and filter location updates to provide location updates that meet your accuracy
    requirements.

    You can further limit power consumption on iOS by setting the
    [distanceFilter](Titanium.Geolocation.distanceFilter) property to eliminate position
    updates when the user is not moving.

    In order to receive the user's location, add either the
    [`NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW26)
    or
    [`NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription`](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW26)
    key to the iOS plist section of the project's `tiapp.xml` file.

    ``` xml
    <ti:app>
        <ios>
            <plist>
                <dict>
                    <key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
                    <string>
                        Specify the reason for accessing the user's location information.
                        This appears in the alert dialog when asking the user for permission to
                        access their location.
                    </string>
                </dict>
            </plist>
        </ios>
    </ti:app>
    ```

    For iOS 11 and later, also add the [`NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/choosing_the_authorization_level_for_location_services/request_always_authorization)
    when planning to request the "Always" permission. Using the above key, you are also able to upgrade your permissions from
    "When in Use" to "Always", which is the recommended way for managing location permissions in iOS 11 and later.
    Please also remember to request your desired location-permissions before using any geolocation-related API in
    order to receive the best usability and permission-control during the app-lifecycle using <Titanium.Geolocation.hasLocationPermissions>
    and <Titanium.Geolocation.requestLocationPermissions>. Also note that you also need to include the `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` key
    in *any* case when targeting iOS 11 and later. Descriptive error-logs will be thrown if required permissions are missing.

    #### Configurating Location Updates on Android

    On Android, two different location service modes are supported: *simple*, and *manual*.

    *   *Simple mode* provides a compromise mode that provides adaquate support for
        undemanding location applications without requiring developers to
        write a lot of Android-specific code. To use simple mode:

        1.   Leave the <Titanium.Geolocation.Android.manualMode> flag set to `false` (the
             default value).

        2.   Set the [accuracy](Titanium.Geolocation.accuracy) property to
             either [ACCURACY_HIGH](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_HIGH) or
             [ACCURACY_LOW](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_LOW).

    *   *Manual mode* gives developers low-level control of location updates, including
        enabling individual location providers and filtering updates, for the best
        combination of accuracy and battery life.

        Manual mode is used when the <Titanium.Geolocation.Android.manualMode> flag is set
        to `true`. In manual mode, the `accuracy` property is not used, and all
        configuration is done through the <Titanium.Geolocation.Android> module.

    As of Titanium SDK 7.1.0 and later, including the [`ti.playservices`](https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.playservices) module will allow Google Play Services 
    to be used by default to obtain location information. This means the provider passed into [createLocationProvider](Titanium.Geolocation.Android.createLocationProvider)
    will be ignored, as Google Play Services will select the best provider based on current device conditions.
    If Google Play Services is not available it will fallback to previous behaviour of using Android location APIs.

    To retrieve location events:

    ``` js
    var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({ backgroundColor: 'white' });

    Ti.Geolocation.accuracy = Ti.Geolocation.ACCURACY_HIGH;

    function getLocation() {
        Ti.Geolocation.addEventListener('location', function(e) {
            alert(JSON.stringify(e, null, 2));
        });
    }

    win.addEventListener('open', function() {
        if (Ti.Geolocation.hasLocationPermissions()) {
            getLocation();
          } else {
            Ti.Geolocation.requestLocationPermissions(Ti.Geolocation.AUTHORIZATION_ALWAYS, function(e) {
                if (e.success) {
                    getLocation();
                } else {
                    alert('could not obtain location permissions');
                }
            });
        }
    });

    win.open();
    ```

    #### Using the Compass

    Both iOS and Android support a receiving heading updates from a hardware compass, if available.

    Check the [hasCompass](Titanium.Geolocation.hasCompass) property to see if the current
    device supports a compass.

    To retrieve compass readings, you can either use
    [getCurrentHeading](Titanium.Geolocation.getCurrentHeading) as shown in the
    previous example, or add a listener for the
    [heading](Titanium.Geolocation.heading) event, as shown below:

    ``` js
    function compassHandler (e) {
      if (e.success) {
        Ti.API.info('Heading: ' + e.heading.magneticHeading);
      }
    }
    Ti.Geolocation.addEventListener('heading', compassHandler);
    ```

    Note that Android did not include a `success` property in the `heading` event prior to SDK 7.5.0.
    Heading events are only generated on Android when heading data is available. So if
    `success` is undefined on prior SDK versions, we assume that the event contains valid compass data.

    To obtain true heading data for the compass (as opposed to magnetic heading data),
    a current location fix is required. See the notes on
    [trueHeading](HeadingData.trueHeading) for more information.

    As with location updates, the application should unregister for heading updates
    when it is no longer being used, or when it goes into the background. Use
    `removeEventListener` to stop heading updates:

    ``` js
    Ti.Geolocation.removeEventListener('heading', compassHandler);
    ```

    Finally, note that neither the Android emulator nor the iOS simulator provide
    compass support. Compass code must be tested on physical devices.

    #### Geocoding Services

    The module provides two methods, [forwardGeocoder](Titanium.Geolocation.forwardGeocoder) and [reverseGeocoder](Titanium.Geolocation.reverseGeocoder)
    to convert between geographic coordinates and addresses. These methods map to MapQuest Open Nominatim Search Service.

    While this API has the advantage that it has no daily usage limits, please note that the data backing this API is crowd sourced and might not return
    proper values for valid addresses and geographic coordinates.

    If geocoding services are essential component of the application, developers are encouraged to use commercial geocoding providers.

    since: "5.1.0"

  - name: requestLocationPermissions
    summary: Requests for location access.
    description: |
        On Android, the request view will show if the permission is not accepted by the user, and the user did
        not check the box "Never ask again" when denying the request. If the user checks the box "Never ask again,"
        the user has to manually enable the permission in device settings. If the user asks for permissions or
        tries to get unauthorized location information, then the app should call the request method to show
        the permission settings. This method requests `Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` on Android.
        If you require other permissions, you can also use <Titanium.Android.requestPermissions>.

        In iOS 8, Apple introduced the Info.plist keys `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` and `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription`
        that are used to display an own description while requesting location permissions. In addition to this method, you need to
        include one of these keys (based on how your location updates should behave) or the application will crash if your app does not.

        In iOS 11, Apple introduced another Info.plist key `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` that allows developers to upgrade
        their permissions from "When in Use" to "Always". In order to get the best usability for iOS 11 and later, request "When in Use" first
        and upgrade your location-permissions by requesting "Always" permissions later if required. If this permission-flow is not used, iOS
        will still ask the user to select between "When in Use", "Always", and "Don't Allow" (primary action) on iOS 11 when asking for "Always"
        permissions, which can lead to a higher frequence of denied permissions, so be careful requesting location permissions.
        The iOS 11 related upgrade-flow is available in Titanium SDK 6.3.0 and later.

        Finally, iOS 11 and later will require you to *always* include the `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` permission and Titanium will throw a
        descriptive error-log if any required keys are missing.

  - name: requestTemporaryFullAccuracyAuthorization
    summary: Requests the user's permission to temporarily use location services with full accuracy.
    description: |
        If your app doesn't have permission to access accurate location (see [locationAccuracyAuthorization](Titanium.Geolocation.locationAccuracyAuthorization), 
        you can use this method to request temporary access to accurate location.  This access will expire automatically, 
        but it won't expire while the user is still engaged with your app.  So, for example, while your app is in 
        the foreground your app will retain the temporary access it was granted. Similarly, if your app starts a 
        Continuous Background Location session with the background location indicator enabled (see [showBackgroundLocationIndicator](Titanium.Geolocation.showBackgroundLocationIndicator), 
        your access to accurate location will remain as long as the background location indicator remains enabled.  
        This allows your app to provide session-oriented experiences which require accurate location (e.g. fitness or navigation), 
        even if the user has decided not to grant your app persistent access to accurate location. 

        You need to add key `NSLocationTemporaryUsageDescriptionDictionary` in `tiapp.xml`. See following example -

        ``` xml
        <ti:app>
            <ios>
                <plist>
                    <dict>
                        <key>NSLocationTemporaryUsageDescriptionDictionary</key>
                        <dict>
                            <key>PurposeKey1</key>
                            <string>
                                Specify the reason for accessing the user's location data with full accuracy.
                                This appears in the alert dialog when asking the user for permission to
                                access their location.
                            </string>
                            <key>PurposeKey2</key>
                            <string>
                                Specify the reason for accessing the user's location data with full accuracy.
                                This appears in the alert dialog when asking the user for permission to
                                access their location.
                            </string>
                        </dict>
                    </dict>
                </plist>
            </ios>
        </ti:app>
        ```

        When CoreLocation prepares the prompt for display, it will look at the NSLocationTemporaryUsageDescriptionDictionary key 
        in your tiapp.xml.  The value should be a dictionary containing usage descriptions.  The purposeKey you provide to 
        this method must correspond to an entry in that dictionary.
    parameters:

        *   [ACCURACY_HIGH](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_HIGH) for higher-quality location
            updates, with the higher power consumption.
        *   [ACCURACY_LOW](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_LOW) for lower-quality location
            updates with lower power consumption.

        For finer-grained control on iOS, specify one of `ACCURACY_BEST`,
        `ACCURACY_NEAREST_TEN_METERS`, `ACCURACY_HUNDRED_METERS`, `ACCURACY_KILOMETER`, or
        `ACCURACY_THREE_KILOMETERS`.

        For finer-grained control on Android, use *manual mode*, instead of specifing an accuracy.
        This mode requires more active management on the part of the application, but it
        is recommended to maximize accuracy and battery life.

        in the background.

        Note that this property only applies to apps with Always authorization.

        devices with cellular radios.

        This service offers a significant power savings and provides accuracy that is good
        enough for most applications. It uses the device's cellular radio to determine the
        user's location  and report changes in that location, allowing the system to manage
        power usage much more aggressively than it could otherwise. This service is also
        capable of waking up an application that is currently suspended or not running in

        updates may be automatically paused. Pausing updates gives the system the
        opportunity to save power in situations where the user's location is not likely
        to be changing. For example, if the activity type is
        [ACTIVITYTYPE_AUTOMOTIVE_NAVIGATION](Titanium.Geolocation.ACTIVITYTYPE_AUTOMOTIVE_NAVIGATION)
        and no location changes have occurred recently, the radios might be powered down

    summary: Indicates whether the location updates may be paused.
    description: |
        Allowing the location updates to be paused can improve battery life on the
        target device without sacrificing location data. When this property is set to YES,
        the location updates are paused (and powers down the appropriate hardware) at
        times when the location data is unlikely to change. For example, if the user stops
        for food while using a navigation app, the location manager might pause updates for
        a period of time. You can help the determination of when to pause location updates
        by assigning a value to the [activityType](Titanium.Geolocation.activityType) property.

name: HeadingData
summary: Simple object holding compass heading data.
properties:

  - name: accuracy
    summary: Accuracy of the compass heading, in platform-specific units.
    description: |
        On iOS, accuracy is returned as a maximum deviation in degrees,
        the smaller the value, the more accurate the heading is. For example,
        a value of 10 means the heading is plus or minus 10 degrees from the
        actual value. A negative value indicates the compass heading is invalid;
        for example, if there is magnetic interference, or if the compass is not calibrated.

        On Android, the value is set to either 1 (low accuracy), 2 (medium accuracy)
        or 3 (high accuracy). No specific definition of these accuracy values is supplied.
    type: Number

  - name: magneticHeading
    summary: Declination in degrees from magnetic North.
    type: Number

  - name: trueHeading
    summary: Declination in degrees from true North.
    description: |
        Calculating the true heading requires correcting the magnetic declination based on
        the device's current location. So `trueHeading` can only be calculated if the device
        has a fairly recent location fix. If you want to obtain the true heading, you
        should register for location updates as well as compass updates. The location fix
        does not need to be very accurate.

        On Android, `trueHeading` is `undefined` if a recent location fix is not available.

name: LocationProviderDict
summary: Simple object describing a location provider.
description: |
    The `accuracy` and `power` values correspond to constants defined in the
    Android API. See
    [android.location.Criteria](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Criteria.html)
    in the Android API Reference.

    These values are generalizations. In general, a provider with coarse accuracy will
    provide less accurate results than a provider with fine accuracy, and a provider with
    high power requirements will use more battery power than a provider with low power
    requirements.
properties:

  - name: accuracy
    summary: |
        Accuracy of the location provider, either fine (1) or coarse (2).
