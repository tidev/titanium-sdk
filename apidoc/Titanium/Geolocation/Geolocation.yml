summary: The top level Geolocation module. The Geolocation module is used for accessing device location based information.
description: |
    This module combines two sets of features:

    *   Location services. Determining the location of the device.

    *   Geocoding and reverse geocoding. Converting geographic  coordinates into
        addresses, and converting addresses into geographic  coordinates.

    Using location services can have a significant impact on a device's battery life, 
    so it's important to use them in the most efficient manner possible. Power consumption
    is strongly influenced by the accuracy and frequency of location updates required by 
    your application. 
    
    The location services systems of the underlying platforms are very different, so there
    are significant implementation differences between the platforms.

    The basic methods of requesting location information and receiving location updates
    are essentially the same on all platforms. However, the method of configuring the 
    accuracy and frequency of location updates is different for each platform.

    #### Getting Location Information

    There are two ways to get location information:

    *   Make a one-time request with [getCurrentPosition](Titanium.Geolocation.getCurrentPosition).

    *   Register to receive location updates by adding an event listener for the
        [location](Titanium.Geolocation.location) event.

    **NOTE:** Location services stay enabled for as long as a listener is registered for the
    `location` event, so be sure to remove the event listener when you do not require
    location updates.

    #### Configurating Location Updates on iOS

    In iOS, the accuracy (and power consumption) of location services is primarily
    determined by the [accuracy](Titanium.Geolocation.accuracy) setting. This can be set
    to one of the following values:
    
    *   [ACCURACY_BEST](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_BEST) (highest accuracy and power consumption)
    *   [ACCURACY_HIGH](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_HIGH)
    *   [ACCURACY_NEAREST_TEN_METERS](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_NEAREST_TEN_METERS) 
    *   [ACCURACY_HUNDRED_METERS](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_HUNDRED_METERS) 
    *   [ACCURACY_KILOMETER](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_KILOMETER) 
    *   [ACCURACY_LOW](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_LOW)
    *   [ACCURACY_THREE_KILOMETERS](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_THREE_KILOMETERS) (lowest
        accuracy and power consumption). 

    Based on the accuracy you choose, iOS uses its own logic to select location providers
    and filter location updates to provide location updates that meet your accuracy
    requirements.

    You can further limit power consumption on iOS by setting the
    [distanceFilter](Titanium.Geolocation.distanceFilter) property to eliminate position
    updates when the user is not moving.

    #### Configurating Location Updates on Android
    
    Prior to Titanium Mobile 2.0, Titanium attempted to follow the iOS model on Android,
    but this didn't fit the native Android model well. In Release 2.0, three different
    location service modes are supported on Android: *simple*, *manual*, and *legacy*.

    *   *Simple mode* provides a compromise mode that provides adaquate support for 
        undemanding location applications without requiring developers to
        write a lot of Android-specific code. To use simple mode:

        1.   Leave the <Titanium.Geolocation.Android.manualMode> flag set to `false` (the 
             default value).
        
        2.   Set the [accuracy](Titanium.Geolocation.accuracy) property to 
             either [ACCURACY_HIGH](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_HIGH) or 
             [ACCURACY_LOW](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_LOW).

    *   *Manual mode* gives developers low-level control of location updates, including
        enabling individual location providers and filtering updates, for the best
        combination of accuracy and battery life. 

        Manual mode is used when the <Titanium.Geolocation.Android.manualMode> flag is set
        to `true`. In manual mode, the `accuracy` property is not used, and all
        configuration is done through the <Titanium.Geolocation.Android> module.

    *   *Legacy mode* is the mode that existed prior to 2.0. Legacy mode is 
        used when the `manualMode` flag is `false` and the `accuracy` property is 
        set to one of the iOS `ACCURACY` constants:

        *   [ACCURACY_BEST](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_BEST) (highest accuracy and power consumption)
        *   [ACCURACY_NEAREST_TEN_METERS](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_NEAREST_TEN_METERS) 
        *   [ACCURACY_HUNDRED_METERS](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_HUNDRED_METERS) 
        *   [ACCURACY_KILOMETER](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_KILOMETER) 
        *   [ACCURACY_THREE_KILOMETERS](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_THREE_KILOMETERS) (lowest
            accuracy and power consumption). 
            
        This mode is deprecated and should not be used for new development. 

        In this mode, the specified `accuracy` value determines the 
        *minimum distance between location updates*. If `accuracy` is set to
        `ACCURACY_BEST`, no distance filter is used on updates.
        
        In legacy mode, only a single location provider (GPS, network, or passive) is
        enabled at a time. You can specify a the location provider using the 
        [preferredProvider](Titanium.Geolocation.preferredProvider) property.
        
        You can also specifying a desired update frequency using the
        [frequency](Titanium.Geolocation.frequency) property. The `preferredProvider`
        and `frequency` properties are not used in any other mode.

    #### Configuring Location Updates on Mobile Web

    Location services on Mobile Web operate similarly to the *simple mode* operations on
    Android. Setting [accuracy](Titanium.Geolocation.accuracy) property to 
    [ACCURACY_HIGH](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_HIGH) yeilds the best available location
    updates, with the hightest power consumption.
    Using [ACCURACY_LOW](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_LOW) provides lower-quality location
    updates with lower power consumption.

    In addition to the accuracy setting, there are several Mobile Web-specific settings.
    See <Titanium.Geolocation.MobileWeb> for details.

    #### Using the Compass

    Both iOS and Android support a receiving heading updates from a hardware compass, if available.
    On Mobile Web, heading updates are supported if the browser supports this feature.
    Currently, this support is only available on Mobile Safari.

    Check the [hasCompass](Titanium.Geolocation.hasCompass) property to see if the current
    device supports a compass.

    To retrieve compass readings, you can either use
    [getCurrentHeading](Titanium.Geolocation.getCurrentHeading) as shown in the
    previous example, or add a listener for the
    [heading](Titanium.Geolocation.heading) event, as shown below:

        var compassHandler = function(e) {
          if (e.success === undefined || e.success) {
            Ti.API.info("Heading: " + e.heading.magneticHeading);
          }
        }
        Ti.Geolocation.addEventListener("heading", compassHandler);

    Note that Android does not include a `success` property in the `heading` event.
    Heading events are only generated on Android when heading data is available. So if
    `success` is undefined, we assume that the event contains valid compass data.

    To obtain true heading data for the compass (as opposed to magnetic heading data),
    a current location fix is required. See the notes on
    [trueHeading](HeadingData.trueHeading) for more information.

    As with location updates, the application should unregister for heading updates
    when it is no longer being used, or when it goes into the background. Use
    `removeEventListener` to stop heading updates:

        Ti.Geolocation.removeEventListener('heading', compassHandler);

    Finally, note that neither the Android emulator nor the iOS simulator provide
    compass support. Compass code must be tested on physical devices.

  - name: accuracy
    summary: Specifies the requested accuracy for location updates.
    description: |
        For basic location updates on all platforms, set `accuracy` to either:

        *   [ACCURACY_HIGH](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_HIGH) for higher-quality location
            updates, with the higher power consumption.
        *   [ACCURACY_LOW](Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_LOW) for lower-quality location
            updates with lower power consumption.

        For finer-grained control on iOS, specify one of `ACCURACY_BEST`, 
        `ACCURACY_NEAREST_TEN_METERS`, `ACCURACY_HUNDRED_METERS`, `ACCURACY_KILOMETER`, or
        `ACCURACY_THREE_KILOMETERS`. 

        For finer-grained control on Android, use *manual mode*, instead of specifing an accuracy. 
        This mode requires more active management on the part of the application, but it 
        is recommended to maximize accuracy and battery life.
        See <Titanium.Geolocation.Android> for details on using manual mode.

        Note that for backwards compatibility, Android supports using the iOS accuracy constants. 
        This usage is deprecated. Applications using one of the iOS constants should
        migrate to using `ACCURACY_HIGH`, `ACCURACY_LOW`, or Android manual mode.

---
name: HeadingData
summary: Simple object holding compass heading data.
properties:

  - name: accuracy
    summary: Accuracy of the compass heading, in platform-specific units.
    description: |
        On iOS, accuracy is returned as a maximum deviation in degrees. For example, 
        a value of 10 means the heading is plus or minus degrees from the actual value.
        A negative value indicates the compass heading is invalid; for example,
        if there is magnetic interference, or if the compass is not calibrated.

        On Mobile Web, compass is currently supported only on iOS, and returns the same
        value as iOS native.

        On Android, the value is set to either 1 (low accuracy), 2 (medium accuracy) or 3
        (high accuracy). No specific definition of these accuracy values is supplied.
    type: Number

  - name: magneticHeading
    summary: Declination in degrees from magnetic North.
    type: Number

  - name: trueHeading
    summary: Declination in degrees from true North.
    description: |
        Calculating the true heading requires correcting the magnetic declination based on
        the device's current location. So `trueHeading` can only be calculated if the device
        has a fairly recent location fix. If you want to obtain the true heading, you
        should register for location updates as well as compass updates. The location fix
        does not need to be very accurate.

        On Android, `trueHeading` is `undefined` if a recent location fix is not available.

    type: Number
    platforms: [android, iphone, ipad]

  - name: timestamp
    summary: Timestamp for the heading data, in milliseconds.
    type: Number

name: LocationProviderDict
summary: Simple object describing a location provider.
description: |
    The `accuracy` and `power` values correspond to constants defined in the 
    Android API. See
    [android.location.Criteria](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Criteria.html) 
    in the Android API Reference.

    These values are generalizations. In general, a provider with coarse accuracy will
    provide less accurate results than a provider with fine accuracy, and a provider with
    high power requirements will use more battery power than a provider with low power
    requirements.
properties:

  - name: accuracy
    summary: |
        Accuracy of the location provider, either fine (1) or coarse (2).
