summary: Module for Android-specific geolocation functionality.
description: |
    This module is used for manually configuring geolocation settings on Android. 

    Manual configuration is recommended for applications that have more demanding 
    geolocation needs (for example, driving directions). However, for basic geolocation
    information, *simple mode* geolocation may be sufficient. For information on simple 
    mode, see <Titanium.Geolocation>.

    Manual configuration involves managing *providers* and *rules*:

    *   *Location providers*, such as GPS, provide location updates.

    *   *Location rules* filter the results returned by location providers. 

    Configuring geolocation manually involves three steps:

    1.  Enabling manual mode.

    2.  Enabling location providers.

    3.  Adding location rules (optional).

    As with the other modes, you register for location updates using the main
    <Titanium.Geolocation> module. Location updates are generated as long as 
    an event listener is registered for the `location` event.  When you are not 
    using location updates, you should remove any registered event listeners.

    In manual mode, the application is responsible for dynamically updating the settings
    to acheive its required accuracy while limiting battery usage. For example, an
    application might do any of the following:

    *   If the application isn't getting updates frequently enough, it can adjust its
        provider settings to provide more updates, or relax its location rules to allow
        less accurate updates through. 

    *   If the application isn't receiving accurate enough updates from one provider, it 
        can add another provider to try to improve results.

    *   If the application is getting sufficiently accurate results from the network 
        provider, it can disable the GPS provider to save power.

    #### Enabling Manual Configuration Mode

    To enable manual configuration mode, set the [manualMode](Titanium.Geolocation.Android.manualMode) 
    property to `true`. In manual configuration mode, the location providers and location
    rules set through this module control the generation of location updates.

    When `manualMode` is `true`, the following configuration settings in the
    <Titanium.Geolocation> module are ignored:

    *   [Geolocation.accuracy](Titanium.Geolocation.accuracy)
    *   [Geolocation.frequency](Titanium.Geolocation.frequency)
    *   [Geolocation.preferredProvider](Titanium.Geolocation.preferredProvider)

    When `manualMode` is `false`, the `accuracy`, `frequency` and `preferredProvider`
    settings from <Titanium.Geolocation> are used to configure location updates.
    Any location providers and location rules set in <Titanium.Geolocation.Android> 
    are retained, but they have no effect.

    #### Location Providers

    Android supports three kinds of location providers: GPS, network, and the 
    "passive" location provider, which provides only cached information. 

    Each location provider represents a different tradeoff between accuracy and
    battery power. For most accurate results, you can use a combination of location
    providers. Your application can also dynamically change providers to optimize
    battery life (for example, if the network provider is providing good enough
    location updates, you can disable the GPS provider).

    Location providers are represented by the
    [LocationProvider](Titanium.Geolocation.Android.LocationProvider) object. 
    To specify a location provider, create a new provider object, then register it
    with [addLocationProvider](Titanium.Geolocation.Android.createLocationProvider):

    ``` js
    var gpsProvider = Ti.Geolocation.Android.createLocationProvider({
        name: Ti.Geolocation.Android.PROVIDER_GPS,
        minUpdateTime: 60, 
        minUpdateDistance: 100
    });
    Ti.Geolocation.Android.addLocationProvider(gpsProvider);
    ```

    As shown above, when you create a location provider, you can specify two
    properties to limit update frequency:

    *   `minUpdateTime`. Limits the frequency of location updates to no more 
        than one per `minUpdateTime` seconds.

    *   `minUpdateDistance`. Don't send location updates until the location changes
        at least `minUpdateDistance` meters.

    Only one provider of each type (GPS, network, passive) can be registered at a
    time. Adding a new location provider with the same `name` value replaces any
    existing provider with the same `name`.

    Once a location provider is added, changes made to the location provider object itself
    (such as changing its `minUpdateTime` value) change the active configuration of the 
    location system.

    #### Location Rules

    *Location Rules* filter the results returned by location providers. You use
    location rules to reduce the number of location update events, and ensure that 
    the events you do receive are as accurate and recent as your application requires.

    You are not required to set any location rules. However, by reducing the number of 
    location events that are passed from the native code
    to the JavaScript layer, location rules can improve both performance and battery
    life.

    Location rules are represented by the
    [LocationRule](Titanium.Geolocation.Android.LocationProvider) object. To
    specify a location rule, create a new rule object, then register it with 
    [addLocationRule](Titanium.Geolocation.Android.createLocationProvider):

    ``` js
    var gpsRule = Ti.Geolocation.Android.createLocationRule({
        provider: Ti.Geolocation.PROVIDER_GPS,
        // Updates should be accurate to 100m
        accuracy: 100,
        // Updates should be no older than 5m
        maxAge: 300000
        // But  no more frequent than once per 10 seconds
        minAge: 10000
    });
    Ti.Geolocation.Android.addLocationRule(gpsRule);
    ```
    
    Each rule can specify any combination of the following criteria:

    *   `provider`. If specified, this rule only applies to updates generated
        by the specified provider. If not specified, this rule applies to all updates.

    *   `accuracy`. Minimum accuracy required for a location update. Accuracy is
        expressed as the maximum allowable error, in meters. Updates with reported
        accuracy values greater than this are filtered out. 

    *   `minAge`. Controls the frequency of location updates. Do not forward an update unless
         at least `minAge` milliseconds have passed since the last good location
         update.

    *   `maxAge`. Controls the freshness of location updates. Do not forward an update
        unless it is newer than `maxAge` milliseconds.

    You can specify as many location rules as you like. The order in which location rules
    are added is not significant. For a `location` event to be generated, the location
    update must pass all of the active rules.

    Note that some combinations of rules may make it very difficult to get location
    updates. In particular, very low values for either `accuracy` or `maxAge` may prevent 
    results from getting through.
