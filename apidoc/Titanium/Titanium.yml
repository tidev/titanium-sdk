    returns:
        type: Titanium.Buffer

    examples:
      - title: Create a buffer with 1K bytes
        example: |
            
                var buffer = Ti.createBuffer({ length: 1024 });
      - title: Create a buffer with string
        example: |
            Create a buffer with the string "hello world" encoded in UTF-8
            
                var buffer = Ti.createBuffer({ value: "hello world" });
      - title: Create a buffer with encoded float
        example: |
            Create a buffer with the encoded value of the double-precision floating point number 1.234567 in Big Endian (network) byte order
            
                var buffer = Ti.createBuffer({ value: 1.234567, type: Ti.Codec.TYPE_DOUBLE, byteOrder: Ti.Codec.BIG_ENDIAN });

notes: |
    Titanium provides a number of built-in objects in the Javascript that are not part of the Titanium namespace.  Specifically, the following are available.

    #### JSON

    Titanium has a built-in JSON parser with two main functions: `parse` and `stringify`.  `JSON.parse` will safely evaluate a string encoded as Javascript into a Javascript object.  `JSON.stringify` will encode a Javascript object into a string.

    #### Timers

    Titanium has built-in support for one-shot and repeating timers with two main functions: `setTimeout` and `setInterval`.  `setTimeout` takes 2 arguments: function and timeout in milliseconds after which the function should be executed and returns a timer handle that can be used to cancel a pending timer with `clearTimeout`.  `setInterval` takes 2 arguments: function and timeout in milliseconds for how often the function should be executed until cancelled and returns a timer handle that can be used to cancel a timer with `clearInterval`.

    #### Alert

    Titanium has a built-in convenience function `alert` which can be used as a shortcut to <Titanium.UI.createAlertDialog> for creating a message box.  Note that unlike a web browser-based version of `alert`, the method is asynchronous. However, only one alert dialog will be visible and modal at a time.

    #### Locale

    The macro `L` can also be used which aliases the method <Titanium.Locale.getString>.

    #### String formatting

    The following are built-in functions available on the `String` class which are Titanium specific and will aid in formatting strings into a locale-specific string.

    `String.format`: format a generic string using the [IEEE printf specification](http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/printf.html).

    `String.formatDate`: format a date into a locale specific date format. Optionally pass a second argument (string) as either "short" (default), "medium" or "long" for controlling the date format.

    `String.formatTime`: format a date into a locale specific time format.

    `String.formatDecimal`: format a number into a locale specific decimal format.

    `String.formatCurrency`: format a number into a locale specific currency format.

name: CreateBufferArgs
description: Arguments to be passed to createBuffer
since: "1.7"

properties:
  - name: value
    type: [String, Number]
    description: An initial value which will be encoded and placed in the buffer. If value is a Number, type must also be set. (this is simply a convenient way of calling <Titanium.Codec.encodeString> or <Titanium.Codec.encodeNumber> and placing the encoded value in the returned buffer.)
    optional: true
  - name: length
    type: Number
    description: The length of the buffer.
    optional: true
    default: 0, unless `value` is specified, in which case the length of the encoded data is used.
  - name: type
    type: String
    description: The type of data encoding to use with `value`.
    optional: true
    default: <Titanium.Codec.CHARSET_UTF8> if `value` is a String, If `value` is a Number, this argument is required
  - name: byteOrder
    type: Number
    description: The byte order of this buffer.
    optional: true
    default: The OS native byte order is used by default. See <Titanium.Codec.getNativeByteOrder>
