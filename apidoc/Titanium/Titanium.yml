summary: The top level Titanium module.
description: |
    Titanium provides a number of built-in JavaScript objects that are not part
    of the Titanium namespace, including JSON parsing, String formatting,
    timers, and the CommonJS `require` function. See [Global APIs](Global) for
    details.

methods:

    summary: Includes JavaScript code from one or more files.

        The `include` method has several interesting quirks:

        -   The included JavaScript is interpreted in the current root execution
        context -- that is, either `app.js` or in the root context of a window
        opened with the `url` property. For example, in the following code
        snippet, the included code in `some_module.js` has access to
        `globalVar`, but *not* to the local variable, `localVar`:

                var globalVar = {};
                function loadModule() {
                    var localVar = "A local value.";
                    Ti.include('some_module.js');
                };
                loadModule();
        

        -   The included filename is interpreted *local to the current file*. For 
        example, suppose `a.js` includes `dir/b.js.` If `b.js` includes another file, 
        `c.js`, this is interpreted as `dir/c.js`.

        -   Calling `include` from an event handler does not work consistently across 
        platforms.

        -   Calling `include` on a non-existent file causes a runtime error.
        See also [CommonJS Require](Global.require).
    parameters:
      - name: name
        summary: Filename(s) to include. 
        type: String

  - name: createBuffer
    summary: Creates a new buffer based on the params.
    parameters:
      - name: params
        summary: creation arguments
        type: CreateBufferArgs
    returns:
        type: Titanium.Buffer
        summary: The new buffer.
    platforms: [android, iphone, ipad]
    examples:
      - title: Create a buffer with 1K bytes
        example: |
            
                var buffer = Ti.createBuffer({ length: 1024 });
      - title: Create a buffer with string
        example: |
            Create a buffer with the string "hello world" encoded in UTF-8
            
                var buffer = Ti.createBuffer({ value: "hello world" });
      - title: Create a buffer with encoded float
        example: |
            Create a buffer with the encoded value of the double-precision floating point 
            number 1.234567 in Big Endian (network) byte order
            
                var buffer = Ti.createBuffer({ value: 1.234567, type: Ti.Codec.TYPE_DOUBLE, byteOrder: Ti.Codec.BIG_ENDIAN });

name: CreateBufferArgs
summary: Arguments to be passed to createBuffer
since: "1.7"
platforms: [android, iphone, ipad]

properties:
  - name: value
    type: [String, Number]
    summary: An initial value which will be encoded and placed in the buffer. If value is a Number, type must also be set. (this is simply a convenient way of calling <Titanium.Codec.encodeString> or <Titanium.Codec.encodeNumber> and placing the encoded value in the returned buffer.)
    optional: true
  - name: length
    type: Number
    summary: The length of the buffer.
    optional: true
    default: 0, unless `value` is specified, in which case the length of the encoded data is used.
  - name: type
    type: String
    summary: The type of data encoding to use with `value`.
    optional: true
    default: <Titanium.Codec.CHARSET_UTF8> if `value` is a String, If `value` is a Number, this argument is required
  - name: byteOrder
    type: Number
    summary: The byte order of this buffer.
    optional: true
    default: The OS native byte order is used by default. See <Titanium.Codec.getNativeByteOrder>
