name: Titanium.Analytics
summary: |
    Used for transmitting developer-defined Analytics events to the Appcelerator Analytics product. 
description: |
    The analytics module can be used to supply additional context or application-specific 
    information which can then be accessed during analysis using Analytics.

    Use the [featureEvent](Titanium.Analytics.featureEvent) method to generate custom
    events that you can view through the Analytics product. You can specify a name for 
    the feature event which is visible through Analytics.

    **NOTE** Although the analytics module allows you to transmit other types of 
    events, such as navigation events and timed events, *data regarding these events 
    is **not** accessible through the Analytics UI.* 
    
    Navigation events will be supported in a future version of the Analytics product. 
    There is no plan to support the other event types, and they and should not be used.

    example: |
        This example shows how to send a feature event during an application session to indicate 
        some feature that you would like to track was used.
        
            Titanium.Analytics.featureEvent('app.feature.blah');
        
        In this case, the Analytics product would show statistics about how many times the
        'app.feature.blah' event was generated.
