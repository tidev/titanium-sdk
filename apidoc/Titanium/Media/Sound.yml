name: Titanium.Media.Sound
summary: An object for playing basic audio resources.
description: |
    The `Sound` object loads the entire media resource in memory before playing.  If you need to 
    support streaming, use the [AudioPlayer](Titanium.Media.AudioPlayer) API.

    You can control how the sound interacts with other system sounds
    by setting <Titanium.Media.audioSessionMode>.

    Use the <Titanium.Media.createSound> method to create a `Sound` object. You can play audio 
    in any format supported by the target platform(s), as described in the following documents:

    * [Android](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/media-formats#core)
    * [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/audio/)
