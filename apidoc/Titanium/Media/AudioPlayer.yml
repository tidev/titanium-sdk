name: Titanium.Media.AudioPlayer
summary: |
    An audio player object used for streaming audio to the device, and low-level control of the audio playback.
description: |
    On Android, when you are done playing a given audio file, you must call the
    [release](Titanium.Media.AudioPlayer.release) method to stop buffering audio data and
    release associated system resources.

    On iOS, you can control how the audio stream interacts with other system sounds
    by setting <Titanium.Media.audioSessionMode>.

    Use the <Titanium.Media.createAudioPlayer> method to create an audio player.

    example: |
        The following example demonstrates using the `AudioPlayer` object to stream audio.

            var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
                title: 'Audio Test',
                backgroundColor: '#fff',
                layout: 'vertical'
            });

            var startStopButton = Ti.UI.createButton({
                title: 'Start/Stop Streaming',

                width: 200,
                height: 40
            });

            var pauseResumeButton = Ti.UI.createButton({
                title: 'Pause/Resume Streaming',
                top: 10,
                width: 200,
                height: 40,

            win.add(startStopButton);
            win.add(pauseResumeButton);

            // allowBackground: true on Android allows the
            // player to keep playing when the app is in the
            // background.

            });

            startStopButton.addEventListener('click',function() {
                // When paused, playing returns false.
                // If both are false, playback is stopped.
                if (audioPlayer.playing || audioPlayer.paused) {

                        audioPlayer.release();
                    }
                } else {
                    audioPlayer.start();
                    pauseResumeButton.enabled = true;
                }
            });

            pauseResumeButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
                if (audioPlayer.paused) {
                    audioPlayer.start();

                    audioPlayer.pause();
                }
            });

            audioPlayer.addEventListener('progress', function(e) {
                Ti.API.info('Time Played: ' + Math.round(e.progress) + ' milliseconds');

            });

            win.addEventListener('close',function() {

  - name: pause
    summary: Pauses audio playback.
    description: |
        On iOS, the `pause` call operates as a toggle. If the stream is already paused,
        calling `pause` again resumes playing the stream.

        On Android, the `pause` call does nothing if the stream is already paused.

        On both platforms, calling [start](Titanium.Media.AudioPlayer.start) on a paused
        stream resumes play.

  - name: play
    summary: Starts or resumes audio playback.
    description: |
        This method is identical to [start](Titanium.Media.AudioPlayer.start).

        it is preferable to use the [pause](Titanium.Media.AudioPlayer.pause) and
        [start](Titanium.Media.AudioPlayer.start) methods instead.
    parameters:
      - name: paused
        summary: Pass `true` to pause the current playback temporarily, `false` to unpause it.
