name: Titanium.Media.AudioPlayer
summary: |
    An audio player object used for streaming audio to the device, and low-level control of the audio playback.
description: |
    On Android, when you are done playing a given audio file, you must call the 
    [release](Titanium.Media.AudioPlayer.release) method to stop buffering audio data and 
    release associated system resources.

    On iOS, you can control how the audio stream interacts with other system sounds
    by setting <Titanium.Media.audioSessionMode>.

    Use the <Titanium.Media.createAudioPlayer> method to create an audio player.

    example: |
        The following example demonstrates using the `AudioPlayer` object to stream audio.

            var win = Titanium.UI.createWindow({  
                title:'Audio Test',
                backgroundColor:'#fff',
                layout: 'vertical'
            });
            
            var startStopButton = Titanium.UI.createButton({
                title:'Start/Stop Streaming',
                top:10,
                width:200,
                height:40
            });
            
            var pauseResumeButton = Titanium.UI.createButton({
                title:'Pause/Resume Streaming',
                top:10,
                width:200,
                height:40,
                enabled:false
            });
            
            win.add(startStopButton);
            win.add(pauseResumeButton);
            
            // allowBackground: true on Android allows the 
            // player to keep playing when the app is in the 
            // background.
            var audioPlayer = Ti.Media.createAudioPlayer({ 
                url: 'www.example.com/podcast.mp3',
                allowBackground: true
            });           
                
            startStopButton.addEventListener('click',function() {
                // When paused, playing returns false.
                // If both are false, playback is stopped.
                if (audioPlayer.playing || audioPlayer.paused)
                {
                    audioPlayer.stop();
                    pauseResumeButton.enabled = false;
                    if (Ti.Platform.name === 'android')

  - name: pause
    summary: Pauses audio playback.
    description: |
        On iOS, the `pause` call operates as a toggle. If the stream is already paused,
        calling `pause` again resumes playing the stream.

        On Android, the `pause` call does nothing if the stream is already paused.

        On both platforms, calling [start](Titanium.Media.AudioPlayer.start) on a paused
        stream resumes play.
  - name: play
    summary: Starts or resumes audio playback.
    description: |
        This method is identical to [start](Titanium.Media.AudioPlayer.start).
    platforms: [android]
  - name: setPaused
    summary: Sets the value of the [paused](Titanium.Media.AudioPlayer.paused) property.
    description: |
        On iOS, this method can be used to pause and unpause playback. For portability,
        it is preferable to use the [pause](Titanium.Media.AudioPlayer.pause) and 
        [start](Titanium.Media.AudioPlayer.start) methods instead.
    parameters:
      - name: paused
        summary: Pass `true` to pause the current playback temporarily, `false` to unpause it.
        type: Boolean
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
  - name: getUrl
    summary: Returns the value of the [url](Titanium.Media.AudioPlayer.url) property.

            currentURL = myAudioPlayer.url;
    returns:
        type: String
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
  - name: release
    summary: Stops buffering audio data and releases audio resources.
    description: |
        On Android, this method should be called when you are done streaming a given
        audio object, to release underlying resources, including buffered data.
