name: Titanium.Media.AudioPlayer
summary: |
    An audio player object used for streaming audio to the device, and low-level control of the audio playback.
description: |
    On Android, when you are done playing a given audio file, you must call the
    [release](Titanium.Media.AudioPlayer.release) method to stop buffering audio data and
    release associated system resources. Since 7.5.0, this method is available on iOS as well
    and will release all audio-player related resources. After this method has been called,
    the object should not be accessed anymore.

    On iOS, you can control how the audio stream interacts with other system sounds
    by setting <Titanium.Media.audioSessionCategory>. Since Titanium 7.5.0, this API
    uses the [AVPlayer API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayer) for a more modern
    and performant audio playback.

    Use the <Titanium.Media.createAudioPlayer> method to create an audio player.

    example: |
        The following example demonstrates using the `AudioPlayer` object to stream audio.

        ``` js
        var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
            title: 'Audio Test',
            backgroundColor: '#fff',

        var startStopButton = Ti.UI.createButton({
            title: 'Start/Stop Streaming',
            top: 10,
            width: 200,
            height: 40
        });

        var pauseResumeButton = Ti.UI.createButton({
            title: 'Pause/Resume Streaming',
            top: 10,
            width: 200,
            height: 40,

        });

        win.add(startStopButton);
        win.add(pauseResumeButton);

        // allowBackground: true on Android allows the
        // player to keep playing when the app is in the
        // background.
        var audioPlayer = Ti.Media.createAudioPlayer({
            url: 'www.example.com/podcast.mp3',
            allowBackground: true
        });

        startStopButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
            // When paused, playing returns false.
            // If both are false, playback is stopped.
            if (audioPlayer.playing || audioPlayer.paused) {
                audioPlayer.stop();

  - name: pause
    summary: Pauses audio playback.
    description: |
        On iOS, the `pause` call operates as a toggle. If the stream is already paused,
        calling `pause` again resumes playing the stream.

        On Android, the `pause` call does nothing if the stream is already paused.

        On both platforms, calling [Titanium.Media.AudioPlayer.start](Titanium.Media.AudioPlayer.start) on a paused
        stream resumes play.

  - name: play
    summary: Starts or resumes audio playback.
    deprecated:

        instance and it's observers. Note: If you are listening to the `progress` event,
        you should remove and re-add the event listener.
