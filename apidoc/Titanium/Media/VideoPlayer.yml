name: Titanium.Media.VideoPlayer
summary: A native control for playing videos.
description: | 
    The video player is a native view that can be used to play videos, either stored
    locally or streamed from a web server. The player can occupy the full screen, or can
    be used as a view that can be added to other views.

    Use the <Titanium.Media.createVideoPlayer> method to create a video player.

    #### Platform Implementation Notes

    All platforms support specifying the video content as a URL, either to a local file or
    a remote stream. This is done by setting the [url](Titanium.Media.VideoPlayer.url) property.

    On iOS, video content can also be specified as a [Blob](Titanium.Blob) or
    [File](Titanium.Filesystem.File) object using the
    [media](Titanium.Media.VideoPlayer.media) property.

    On iOS, a video player can dynamically switch back and forth between fullscreen mode
    and standard mode. If the native video controls are displayed, the user can use them
    to switch between standard and fullscreen mode. 

    On Android, the video player cannot switch modes. To create a fullscreen player, you
    must specify `fullscreen: true` when you create the player. This fullscreen player
    creates its own Android [Activity](Titanium.Android.Activity) on top of the activity stack.
    Unlike a normal view, this fullscreen video player appears as soon as it is created. 
    The user can close the player by pressing the **Back** button. See the code examples for 
    a sample using the fullscreen player on Android.

    There are several known issues with clipping on the Android video player. 

    * When used with `scalingMode` set to VIDEO_SCALING_ASPECT_FILL or VIDEO_SCALING_NONE,
      the video content is not correctly clipped to the boundaries of the view.  
      ([TIMOB-7628](https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/TIMOB-7628))

    * When a border is set on the view, the video content does not take the border width
      into account, so the video content covers the border.
      ([TIMOB-7628](https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/TIMOB-7628))

    * If a borderRadius is specified, the video content is not clipped to the rounded
      corners. ([TIMOB-7629](https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/TIMOB-7629))

examples: 
  - title: Simple Video Player Example
    example: |
        The following code creates a simple video player to play a local video file.

            var vidWin = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
                title : 'Video View Demo',
                backgroundColor : '#fff'
            });
            
            var videoPlayer = Titanium.Media.createVideoPlayer({
                top : 2,
                autoplay : true,
                backgroundColor : 'blue',
                height : 300,
                width : 300,
                mediaControlStyle : Titanium.Media.VIDEO_CONTROL_DEFAULT,
                scalingMode : Titanium.Media.VIDEO_SCALING_ASPECT_FIT
            });
            
            videoPlayer.url = 'movie.mp4';
            vidWin.add(videoPlayer);
            vidWin.open();

  - title: Android Fullscreen Video Player
    example: |
        The Android fullscreen video player operates differently from other video players.
        The following example shows how to create, show, and close a fullscreen video
        player. 
        
        Note that in this example, a button is included to close the player, to
        demonstrate a method for dismissing the player programmatically. In practice, the user
        can always dismiss the player by using the **Back** button, so an on-screen
        control would not be required.
        
            Titanium.UI.setBackgroundColor('#000');
            var win = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
                title : 'Test',

methods:

  - name: cancelAllThumbnailImageRequests
    summary: Cancels all pending asynchronous thumbnail requests.
    description: |
        Asynchronous thumbnail requests initiated with 
        [requestThumbnailImagesAtTimes](Titanium.Media.VideoPlayer.requestThumbnailImagesAtTimes).
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]

  - name: pause
    summary: Pauses playing the video.

  - name: play
    summary: Starts playing the video.

  - name: release
    summary: Releases the internal video resources immediately.  
    description: |
        This is not usually necessary but can help if you no longer need to use the player after 
        it is used to help converse memory.

  - name: requestThumbnailImagesAtTimes
    summary: Asynchronously request thumbnail images for one or more points in time in the video.
    description: |
        The `times` parameter specifies an array of time values, in
        **seconds**. For each time value, the platform generates an image 
        representing the video at that point in time.
        
        The callback function is invoked when a thumbnail is available.
        
        Calling this method will cancel all pending asynchronous thumbnail requests.

    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
    parameters:
      - name: times
        summary: Array of time values, representing offsets into the video, in seconds.
        type: Array<Number>

        type: Number
      - name: callback
        summary: Callback to invoke when a thumbnail is available.
        type: Callback<ThumbnailResponse>

  - name: setBackgroundView
    summary: Sets the background view for customization which is always displayed behind movie content.
    description: |
        To create a background behind the movie content on iOS, you can specify a 
        background view. On iOS, you can set the `backgroundColor` property directly on
        the video player, but not a background image or background gradient. For this kind
        of effect, specify a background view. 
        
        Note that the background view must be sized explicitly: percentage sizes do not work properly.

        The following code sample creates a video player with a background image:

            var videoPlayer = Titanium.Media.createVideoPlayer({
                height : 300,
                width : 300,
                backgroundView : Ti.UI.createView({
                    backgroundImage: 'videoPlayerBG.png
                    width : 300,
                    height : 300
                })
                borderRadius : 20,
                borderWidth : 2,
                borderColor : 'blue',
            });

        Note that if [scalingMode](Titanium.Media.VideoPlayer.scalingMode) is set to 
        [VIDEO_SCALING_MODE_FILL](Titanium.Media.VIDEO_SCALING_MODE_FILL) or 
        [VIDEO_SCALING_ASPECT_FILL](Titanium.Media.VIDEO_SCALING_ASPECT_FILL),
        the playing video will fill the entire video player area, obscuring any background
        view.

        There is a subtle difference between singletap and click events.

        A singletap event is generated when the user taps the screen briefly
        without moving their finger. This gesture will also generate a click event.

        However, a click event can also be generated when the user touches, 
        moves their finger, and then removes it from the screen.

        On Android, a click event can also be generated by a trackball click.

    summary: Indicates if a movie should automatically start playback.
    description: |
        On iOS, playback starts automatically if `autoplay` is `true` *and* the movie is likely to 
        finish uninterrupted. The OS determines whether the movie is likely to finish
        uninterrupted based on factors including the bit rate of the movie and network
        conditions (if the movie is being streamed from a remote source).

    summary: The duration of the current movie in milliseconds, or 0.0 if not known.
    description: |
        The duration of the movie may not be available when playback is started. The

    type: Number

  - name: endPlaybackTime
    summary: The end time of movie playback, in milliseconds.
    description: |
        On iOS, defaults to NaN, which indicates natural end time of the movie.
        Changing the value to a value less than `duration` causes the movie to 
        stop playing at the specified point. On iOS, this value is not applicable to
        streaming media, so NaN is returned if the current media is being streamed.
        
        On Android, this is always the same as [duration](Titanium.Media.VideoPlayer.duration)
        (the natural end time), and changing the value has no effect.

        On iOS, setting this property to `true` before the movie player's view is visible
