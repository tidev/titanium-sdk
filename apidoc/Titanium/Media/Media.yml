name: Titanium.Media
summary: The top-level Media module.
description: |
    The Media module is used to access the device's media-related functionality, such
    as using the device's camera and photo gallery, playing media files, or recording
    audio or video.
    For examples of using the Media APIs, refer to the
    [Working with Media APIs guide](https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/Working_with_Media_APIs)
    in addition to the other media submodule API documentation.
    **Note**: Some third party Android camera apps may choose to ignore video recording quality
    settings. If you wish to specifically set the video quality, don't assume
    EXTRA_VIDEO_QUALITY intent will be respected by the camera app and use Titanium's built-in
    camera window which can be used to assign the "overlay" property when calling the
    showCamera() method.

methods:
  - name: beep
    summary: Plays a device beep notification.
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
  - name: hideCamera
    summary: Hides the device camera UI.
    description: |
        Must be called after calling `showCamera` and only when `autohide` is set to `false`.
        This method causes the media capture UI to be hidden.
    platforms: [iphone, ipad, android]
    since:
        android: "3.2.0"
  - name: hideMusicLibrary
    summary: Hides the music library.
    description: |
        Must be called after calling [openMusicLibrary](Titanium.Media.openMusicLibrary)
        and only when `autohide` is set to `false`.
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
  - name: isMediaTypeSupported
    summary: Returns `true` if the source supports the specified media type.
    description: |
        You can query whether a given media type is supported by the device's
        camera (`source` == 'camera') or photo library (`source` == 'photo').

        An additional value, `photogallery` can be  used to query the media
        supported by the device's camera roll or saved image album, which is a
        subset of the iOS photo library. However, when calling
        [openPhotoGallery](Titanium.Media.openPhotoGallery) on iOS, the entire
        library is displayed, and there is currently no way to restrict the
        gallery to show only the camera roll/saved images album.
    returns:
        type: Boolean
    parameters:
      - name: source
        summary: |
            Media source specified as a string: `camera` for Camera or `photo` for Photo Library.
        type: String
      - name: type
        summary: Media type to check.
        type: String
        constants: Titanium.Media.MEDIA_TYPE_*
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
  - name: openMusicLibrary
    summary: Shows the music library and allows the user to select one or more tracks.
    description: |
        If `autohide` is set to `false`, you must hide the library explicitly using
        [hideMusicLibrary](Titanium.Media.hideMusicLibrary).
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
    parameters:

    summary: Opens the photo gallery image picker.
    description: |
        In iOS 6, Apple introduced the Info.plist key `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` that is used to display an
        own description while authorizing gallery permissions. In iOS 10, this key is mandatory and the application
        will crash if your app does not include the key. Check the [Apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html)
        for more information.
    platforms: [iphone, ipad, android]
    parameters:
      - name: options
        summary: Photo gallery options as described in <PhotoGalleryOptionsType>.
        type: PhotoGalleryOptionsType
  - name: previewImage
    summary: Displays the given image.
    platforms: [android]
    parameters:
      - name: options
        summary: Dictionary containing the image and callback functions.
        type: Dictionary<PreviewImageOptions>
  - name: saveToPhotoGallery
    summary: Saves media to the device's photo gallery / camera roll.
    description: |
        This operation is asynchronous. The caller can supply callbacks to be triggered when the
        save operation completes.

        Media can be passed as either a `Blob` object or a `File` object. If the `media` argument
        is not one of these types, an error is generated.

        Note that when passing a file (or a blob created from a file), the file name must
        have the appropriate extension for the data--for example, `image.jpg` or `video1.mov` work,
        but `video1.tmp` does not. Currently, the `.mp4` extension is not supported, but MP4
        files may be imported by saving them with the `.mov` extension.

        On Android this method *only supports saving images* to the device gallery prior to Titanium SDK 6.1.0.

        On iOS the `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription` plist key is required in the tiapp.xml in order
        to use this API. Also make sure to check for the gallery permissions with <Titanium.Media.hasPhotoGalleryPermissions>
        and request the permissions with <Titanium.Media.requestPhotoGalleryPermissions> if not granted so far.

    platforms: [iphone, ipad, android]
    parameters:
      - name: media
        summary: Media to save to the camera roll or media gallery.
        type: [Titanium.Blob, Titanium.Filesystem.File]
      - name: callbacks
        summary: |
            Pass a dictionary with the following supported keys: `success` a function that
            will be called when the save succeeds, and `error` a function that will be
            called upon receiving an error.
        type: Object
    since:
        android: "3.3.0"
  - name: setOverrideAudioRoute
    summary: Overrides the default audio route when using the <Titanium.Media.AUDIO_SESSION_CATEGORY_PLAY_AND_RECORD> session mode.
    description: |
        By default, when using the <Titanium.Media.AUDIO_SESSION_CATEGORY_PLAY_AND_RECORD> session mode,
        the audio output is routed to the speaker in the receiver. This method lets you specify
        that audio should be routed to the built-in speaker.

        If you override the audio route while audio is playing the changes won't not take effect until  the audio is restarted.
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
    parameters:
      - name: route
        summary: The specified audio route.
        type: Number
        constants: Titanium.Media.AUDIO_SESSION_OVERRIDE_ROUTE_*
  - name: showCamera
    summary: Shows the camera.
    description: |
        By default, the native camera controls are displayed. To add your own camera controls,
        you can add an overlay view by setting the `overlay` property on the `options` argument.

        #### Android Platform Notes

        * To suppress the default controls, set `autohide` to `false` and then set the
        `overlay` property to a view that contains a control (such as a button) to
        take the photo. You must then control the camera explicitly, using
        the [takePicture](Titanium.Media.takePicture) and [hideCamera](Titanium.Media.hideCamera)
        methods.
        * Setting `saveToPhotoGallery` to `false` is not guaranteed to work with all camera apps. If this setting is desired, then you should use Titanium's internal camera overlay instead.
        * You can only use one or the other (video or photo) types in the array.

        #### iOS Platform Notes

        To suppress the default controls, set `showControls` and `autohide` to `false`.

        If the `showControls` option is `false`, you must control the camera explicitly, using
        the [takePicture](Titanium.Media.takePicture) and [hideCamera](Titanium.Media.hideCamera)
        methods.

        Images taken with the camera will not have accurate geolocation data embedded in the images;
        the latitude and longitude will be set to '0'.  This is not an error, but a limitation which
        Apple has put on the camera API.

        Important: Use <Titanium.Media.hasCameraPermissions> and <Titanium.Media.requestCameraPermissions>
        to ask for camera permissions. This is especially important when running on iOS 10 and later, since
        the application may crash otherwise.

    platforms: [iphone, ipad, android]
    parameters:
      - name: options
        summary: A dictionary of camera options as described in <CameraOptionsType>.
        type: CameraOptionsType

  - name: hasMusicLibraryPermissions
    summary: Returns `true` if the app has music library access.
    description: |
        Music-library permissions are only needed in iOS 9.3 and later and will be ignored on older
        iOS versions. Because of that, the method will return `true` for devices that run iOS < 9.3.
    returns:
        type: Boolean
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
    since: "6.0.0"
  - name: requestMusicLibraryPermissions
    summary: Request permissions for the native music-library.
    description: |
        Music-library permissions are only needed in iOS 9.3 and later and will be ignored on older
        iOS versions. Because of that, the callback will ignore the permission-check and always return
        `{success: true}` for devices that run iOS < 9.3.

        Important: On iOS 10, Apple introduced the Info.plist key `NSAppleMusicUsageDescription` that is used to
        display an own description while authorizing the music library. This key is mandatory and the application
        will crash if your app does not include the key. Check the [Apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html)
        for more information.
    parameters:

  - name: queryMusicLibrary
    summary: Searches the music library for items matching the specified search predicates.
    description: |
        Use <Titanium.Media.hasMusicLibraryPermissions> to check the granted permissions and
        <Titanium.Media.requestMusicLibraryPermissions> to request the permissions. This is especially important
        when running on an iOS 10 device, because the music-library access will crash without having the privacy-key
        `NSAppleMusicUsageDescription` that is specified in <Titanium.Media.requestMusicLibraryPermissions>.
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
    parameters:
      - name: query
        summary: The query object to extract information from.
        type: MediaQueryType
    returns:

    summary: Uses the device camera to capture a photo.
    description: |
        Must be called after calling `showCamera` and only when `autohide` is set to `false`.

        This method causes the media capture device to capture a photo and call the
        `success` callback.

  - name: requestCameraPermissions
    summary: Requests for camera access.
    description: |
        On Android, the request view will show if the permission is not accepted by the user, and the user did
        not check the box "Never ask again" when denying the request. If the user checks the box "Never ask again,"
        the user has to manually enable the permission in device settings.

        This method requests `Manifest.permission.CAMERA`, `Manifest.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` and `Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` on Android.
        If you require other permissions, you can also use <Titanium.Android.requestPermissions>.

        In iOS 6, Apple introduced the Info.plist key `NSCameraUsageDescription` that is used to display an
        own description while authorizing camera permissions. In iOS 10, this key is mandatory when taking a photo
        and the application will crash if your app does not include the key. Check the [Apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html)
        for more information. When using the camera to take a video, you also need the `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` key.
        In addition, the authorization dialog will only show if user has not made a decision, yet.
        If the user has, the callback will return the earlier decision. To change the permission the user needs to
        change it in the device settings.
    parameters:
      - name: callback

    summary: Requests for camera access.
    description: |
       This method allows the app to request for camera access, before or without the user granting
       it in <Titanium.Media.showCamera>. The request view will only show if user has not yet made
       a decision. If he has, the callback will return his earlier decision, and if any changes has
       to be made, the user has to change it in the device settings.

  - name: vibrate
    summary: Makes the device vibrate.
    description: |
        On Android, a `pattern` argument can be provided to specify a
        vibration pattern.

        The `pattern` is an array of Number values.  Each number in the array is
        interpreted as a duration in milliseconds. The first number is the *delay*
        before the pattern starts, and the remaining numbers are interpreted as
        alternating periods of on and off times. For example, the following pattern:

        ``` js
        [ 0, 500, 100, 500, 100, 500 ]
        ```

        Would cause the vibration to start immediately (delay = 0), and perform three
        long vibrations (500 ms) separated by short pauses (100ms).
    parameters:
      - name: pattern
        summary: Array of values identifying a vibrate pattern (only used on Android).
        optional: true
        type: Array<Number>

        Used in conjunction with the
        [mediaControlStyle](Titanium.Media.VideoPlayer.mediaControlStyle) property
        of [Titanium.Media.VideoPlayer](Titanium.Media.VideoPlayer).

        On iOS, use VIDEO_CONTROL_FULLSCREEN when creating a video player that occupies the entire
        screen, that is, the parent window should be a fullscreen window
        ([fullscreen](Titanium.UI.Window.fullscreen) set to `true`) and the video player should
        occupy the entirety of the parent window.

        If the user clicks the **Done** button in the fullscreen control bar, the video player
        pauses playback and generates a [complete](Titanium.Media.VideoPlayer.complete) event.

        Note that if you create a video player that does *not* occupy the entire screen, and later
        switch to fullscreen mode, the video controls are switched automatically. That is, if
        `mediaControlStyle` is set to VIDEO_CONTROL_DEFAULT or VIDEO_CONTROL_EMBEDDED, it is
        automatically switched to the fullscreen controls when the player enters fullscreen mode.
        This is true whether the user initiates the mode switch by clicking the fullscreen button
        in the embedded controls, or if you programmatically switch to full screen mode (by setting
        the `fullscreen` property to true).

        On Android, this constant has the same effect as VIDEO_CONTROL_DEFAULT. Video controls may
        only be shown or hidden.
