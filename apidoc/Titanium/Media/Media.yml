summary: The top level Media module.  
description: |
    The Media module is used accessing the device's media related  functionality such 
    as playing audio or recording video.
extends: Titanium.Module
since: "0.1"
platforms: [android, iphone, ipad, mobileweb]
methods:
  - name: beep
    summary: Plays a device beep notification.
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
  - name: hideCamera
    summary: Hides the device camera UI. 
    description: |
        Must be called after calling `showCamera` and only when `autohide` is set to `false`. 
        This method causes the media capture UI to be hidden.
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
  - name: hideMusicLibrary
    summary: Hides the music library.  
    description: |
        Must be called after calling [openMusicLibrary](Titanium.Media.openMusicLibrary) 
        and only when `autohide` is set to `false`.
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
  - name: isMediaTypeSupported
    summary: Returns `true` if the source supports the specified media type.
    description: |
        You can query whether a given media type is supported by the device's
        camera (`source` == 'camera') or photo library (`source` == 'photo').  

        An additional value, `photogallery` can be  used to query the media 
        supported by the device's camera roll or saved image album, which is a 
        subset of the iOS photo library. However, when calling 
        [openPhotoGallery](Titanium.Media.openPhotoGallery) on iOS, the entire 
        library is displayed, and there is currently no way to restrict the 
        gallery to show only the camera roll/saved images album. 
    returns:
        type: Boolean
    parameters:
      - name: source
        summary: |
            Media source specified as a string: `camera` for Camera or `photo` for Photo Library.
        type: String
      - name: type
        summary: Media type to check, either `MEDIA_TYPE_PHOTO` or `MEDIA_TYPE_VIDEO`.
        type: String
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
  - name: openMusicLibrary
    summary: Shows the music library and allows the user to select one or more tracks.
    description: |
        If `autohide` is set to `false`, you must hide the library explicitly using 
        [hideMusicLibrary](Titanium.Media.hideMusicLibrary).
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
    parameters:
      - name: options
        summary: A dictionary of options as described in <MusicLibraryOptionsType>.
        type: MusicLibraryOptionsType

    platforms: [iphone, ipad, android]
    parameters:

    parameters:
      - name: options
        summary: Dictionary containing the image and callback functions.
        type: Dictionary<PreviewImageOptions>
  - name: saveToPhotoGallery
    summary: Saves media to the device's photo gallery / camera roll.
    description: |
        This operation is asynchronous. The caller can supply callbacks to be triggered when the
        save operation completes.

        Media can be passed as either a `Blob` object or a `File` object. If the `media` argument
        is not one of these types, an error is generated.

        Note that when passing a file (or a blob created from a file), the file name must 
        have the appropriate extension for the data--for example, `image.jpg` or `video1.mov` work,
        but `video1.tmp` does not. Currently, the `.mp4` extension is not supported, but MP4
        files may be imported by saving them with the `.mov` extension.
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
    parameters:
      - name: media
        summary: Media to save to the camera roll or media gallery. 
        type: [Titanium.Blob, Titanium.Filesystem.File]
      - name: callbacks
        summary: |
            Pass a dictionary with the following supported keys: `success` a function that 
            will be called when the save succeeds, and `error` a function that will be 
            called upon receiving an error.
        type: Object
  - name: showCamera
    summary: Shows the camera.
    description: |
        By default, the native camera controls are displayed. To add your own camera controls,
        you can add an overlay view by setting the `overlay` property on the `options` argument.

        #### iOS Platform Notes

        To suppress the default controls, set `showControls` and `autohide` to `false`.

        If the `showControls` option is `false`, you must control the camera explicitly, using
        the [takePicture](Titanium.Media.takePicture) and [hideCamera](Titanium.Media.hideCamera) 
        methods.
    platforms: [iphone, ipad, android]
    parameters:

  - name: startMicrophoneMonitor
    summary: Starts monitoring the microphone sound level.
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
  - name: stopMicrophoneMonitor
    summary: Stops monitoring the microphone sound level.
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
  - name: takePicture
    summary: Uses the device camera to capture a photo. 
    description: |
        Must be called after calling `showCamera` and only when `autohide` is set to `false`. 

        This method causes the media capture device to capture a photo and call the 
        `success` callback.
    platforms: [iphone, ipad, android]
  - name: takeScreenshot
    summary: Takes a screen shot of the visible UI on the device.
    description: |
       This method is asynchronous. The screenshot is returned in the callback argument.
       The callback argument's `media` property contains the screenshot image as a 
       [Blob](Titanium.Blob) object.
    parameters:
      - name: callback
        summary: Function to call upon capture. 
        type: Callback<ScreenshotResult>
    platforms: [iphone, ipad, android]
  - name: vibrate
    summary: Makes the device vibrate.
    description: |
        On Android and Mobile Web, a `pattern` argument can be provided to specify a
        vibration pattern.

        The `pattern` is an array of Number values.  Each number in the array is 
        interpreted as a duration in milliseconds. The first number is the *delay* 
        before the pattern starts, and the remaining numbers are interpreted as 
        alternating periods of on and off times. For example, the following pattern:

        [ 0, 500, 100, 500, 100, 500 ] 

        Would cause the vibration to start immediately (delay = 0), and perform three
        long vibrations (500 ms) separated by short pauses (100ms).
        
        On Mobile Web, calling `vibrate` without a `pattern` will stop the vibration.
    parameters: 
      - name: pattern
        summary: Array of values identifying a vibrate pattern (only used on Android).
        optional: true
        type: Array<Number>

        Used in conjunction with the
        [mediaControlStyle](Titanium.Media.VideoPlayer.mediaControlStyle) property 
        of <Titanium.Media.VideoPlayer>.

        On Android, this constant has the same effect as VIDEO_CONTROL_DEFAULT. Video controls may

  - name: VIDEO_CONTROL_FULLSCREEN
    summary: Constant for fullscreen video controls. 
    description: |
        Used in conjunction with the
        [mediaControlStyle](Titanium.Media.VideoPlayer.mediaControlStyle) property 
        of <Titanium.Media.VideoPlayer>.

        On iOS, use VIDEO_CONTROL_FULLSCREEN when creating a video player that occupies the entire 
        screen, that is, the parent window should be a fullscreen window 
        ([fullscreen](Titanium.UI.Window.fullscreen) set to `true`) and the video player should 
        occupy the entirety of the parent window.

        If the user clicks the **Done** button in the fullscreen control bar, the video player 
        pauses playback and generates a [complete](Titanium.Media.VideoPlayer.complete) event. 

        Note that if you create a video player that does *not* occupy the entire screen, and later 
        switch to fullscreen mode, the video controls are switched automatically. That is, if 
        `mediaControlStyle` is set to VIDEO_CONTROL_DEFAULT or VIDEO_CONTROL_EMBEDDED, it is 
        automatically switched to the fullscreen controls when the player enters fullscreen mode. 
        This is true whether the user initiates the mode switch by clicking the fullscreen button
        in the embedded controls, or if you programmatically switch to full screen mode (by setting 
        the `fullscreen` property to true). 

        On Android, this constant has the same effect as VIDEO_CONTROL_DEFAULT. Video controls may 
        only be shown or hidden.
