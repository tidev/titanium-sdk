name: Titanium.XML.DOMImplementation
extends: Titanium.Proxy
summary: The <Titanium.XML.DOMImplementation> interface provides a number of methods for
    performing operations that are independent of any particular instance of the document object
    model.Implements the [DOM Level 2 API](https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/core.html#ID-102161490)
    on Android and iOS.

platforms: [android, iphone, ipad, macos]
methods:
  - name: createDocument
    summary: Creates an <Titanium.XML.Document> object of the specified type with its document
        element. Raises an exception if qualifiedName is malformed, contains an illegal character,
        or is inconsistent with namespaceURI. Also raises an exception if doctype has already been
        used with a different document.
    returns:
        type: Titanium.XML.Document
        summary: A new <Titanium.XML.Document> object
    parameters:
      - name: namespaceURI
        summary: The namespace URI of the document element to create.
        type: String
      - name: qualifiedName
        summary: The qualified name of the document element to be created.
        type: String
      - name: doctype
        summary: The type of document to be created or null. When doctype is not null,
            its Node.ownerDocument attribute is set to the document being created.
        type: Titanium.XML.DocumentType
  - name: createDocumentType
    summary: Creates an empty <Titanium.XML.DocumentType> node. Entity declarations and
        notations are not made available. Entity reference expansions and default attribute
        additions do not occur. Raises an exception if qualifiedName is malformed or contains
        an illegal character.
    returns:
        type: Titanium.XML.DocumentType
        summary: A new <Titanium.XML.DocumentType> node with Node.ownerDocument set to null.
    parameters:
      - name: qualifiedName
        summary: The qualified name of the document type to be created.
        type: String
      - name: publicId
        summary: The external subset public identifier.
        type: String
      - name: systemId
        summary: The external subset system identifier.
        type: String
  - name: hasFeature
    summary: Test if the <Titanium.XML.DOMImplementation> implements a specific feature.
    returns:
        type: Boolean
        summary: true if the feature is implemented in the specified version, false otherwise.
    parameters:
      - name: feature
        summary: The name of the feature to test (case-insensitive). The values used by DOM
            features are defined throughout the DOM Level 2 specifications and listed in the
            Conformance section. The name must be an XML name. To avoid possible conflicts, as a
            convention, names referring to features defined outside the DOM specification should
            be made unique by reversing the name of the Internet domain name of the person
            (or the organization that the person belongs to) who defines the feature, component
            by component, and using this as a prefix. For instance, the W3C SVG Working Group
            defines the feature "org.w3c.dom.svg".
        type: String
      - name: version
        summary: This is the version number of the feature to test. In Level 2, the string can
            be either "2.0" or "1.0". If the version is not specified, supporting any version of
            the feature causes the method to return true.
