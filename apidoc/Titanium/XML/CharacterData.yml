name: Titanium.XML.CharacterData
extends: Titanium.XML.Node
summary: An interface extending <Titanium.XML.Node> with a set of
    attributes and methods for accessing character data in the DOM. This
    conforms to the [DOM Level 2](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/core.html)
    defintion of a DOM CharacterData. Unlike the DOM, for reasons of compatibility 
    with the javascript engine, text is represented by UTF-8 instead of UTF-16.
since: "0.9"
createable: false
platforms: [android, iphone, ipad]
methods:
  - name: appendData
    summary: Append the string to the end of the character data of the node. 
        Upon success, data provides access to the concatenation of data and the
        string specified.
        Throws an exception if this node is readonly.
    parameters: 
      - name: arg
        summary: The string to append.
        type: String
  - name: deleteData
    summary: Remove a range of characters from the node. Upon success, data 
        and length reflect the change.
        Throws an exception if this node is readonly, if offset is negative, 
        offset is beyond the data's length, or if count is negative.
    parameters:
      - name: offset
        summary: The offset from which to start removing.
        type: Number
      - name: count
        summary: The number of characters to delete. If the sum of offset 
            and count exceeds length then all characters from offset to the end of 
            the data are deleted.
        type: Number
  - name: insertData
    summary: Insert a string at the specified offset.
        Throws an exception if this node is readonly, if offset is negative, or if offset is beyond the data's length.
    parameters:
      - name: offset
        summary: The character offset at which to insert.
        type: Number
      - name: arg
        summary: The string to insert.
        type: String
  - name: replaceData
    summary: Replace the characters starting at the specified offset with 
        the specified string.
        Throws an exception if this node is readonly, if offset is negative, offset is beyond the data's length, or if count is negative.
    parameters:
      - name: offset
        summary: The offset from which to start replacing.
        type: Number
      - name: count
        summary: The number of characters to replace. If the sum of offset
            and count exceeds length, then all characters to the end of the data 
            are replaced; (i.e., the effect is the same as a remove method call with the same range, followed by an append method invocation).
        type: Number
      - name: arg
        summary: The string with which the range must be replaced.
        type: String
  - name: substringData
    summary: Extracts a range of data from the node.
        Throws an exception if offset is negative, offset is beyond the data's length, or if count is negative.
    returns:
        type: String
        summary: The specified substring. If the sum of offset and count
            exceeds the length, then all 16-bit units to the end of the data
            are returned.
    parameters:
      - name: offset
        summary: Start offset of substring to extract.
        type: Number
      - name: count
        summary: The number of characters units to extract.
        type: Number
properties:
  - name: data
    summary: The character data of the node that implements this interface.
        Throws an exception during setting if this node is readonly.
    type: String
  - name: length
    summary: The number of characters that are available through data and
        the substringData method. This may have the value zero, i.e.,
        <Titanium.XML.CharacterData> may be empty.
