name: Titanium.Blob
summary: A container for binary data.
description: |
    A `Blob` represents a chunk of binary information, often obtained through
    an [HTTPClient](Titanium.Network.HTTPClient) or by reading a [File](Titanium.Filesystem.File).

    Blobs are often used to store text or image data.
    The `Blob` object includes a number of properties and methods specific to image blobs.

    Android supports an [append](Titanium.Blob.append) method, but
    otherwise blobs are immutable.

    The <Titanium.Utils> module provides several utility methods for working with
    blobs, including methods for converting between blobs and Base64-encoded strings,
    and methods for generating SHA-1 and SHA-256 hashes and MD5 digests from blob data.

    The [Buffer](Titanium.Buffer) object can also contain binary data, and is
    more easily mutable. Extracting blob data to a buffer is somewhat roundabout:

    ``` js
    var blobStream = Ti.Stream.createStream({ source: myBlob, mode: Ti.Stream.MODE_READ });
    var newBuffer = Ti.createBuffer({ length: myBlob.length });
    var bytes = blobStream.read(newBuffer);
    ```

    Creating a blob from a buffer is much easier:
    ``` js
    var newBlob = myBuffer.toBlob();
    ```

    In both cases, the conversion involves copying the data from one object to another, so
    you should be conscious of the amount of the data being copied.
