name: Titanium.Map.View
summary: Map view is used for embedding native mapping capabilities as a view in your application.  
description: |
    With native maps, you can control the mapping location, the type of map, the zoom level 
    and you can add custom annotations directly to the map. Once the map view is
    displayed, the user can pan and zoom the map using the native control gestures.
    
    Use the <Titanium.Map.createView> method to create a map view.
    
    All latitude and longitude values are specified in decimal degrees. Values in degrees,
    minutes and seconds (DMS) must be converted to decimal degrees before being passed to
    the map view.
    
    You can add [Annotation](Titanium.Map.Annotation) objects to the map to mark points of
    interest. An annotation has two states: selected and deselected. A deselected annotation 
    is marked by a pin image. When selected, the full annotation is displayed, typically
    including a title, an optional subtitle, and one or more images.
    
    #### Android Platform Notes

    Android supports only a **single** map view per application. This limitation is
    imposed by Android, not by Titanium. Attempting to add a second map view results in
    an exception being thrown.
    
    For Android, you must obtain an Android Maps API key from Google before using maps in a production
    application. You can sign up for the Maps API key on the Google Code web site:
    
    * <a href="http://code.google.com/android/maps-api-signup.html">code.google.com/android/maps-api-signup.html</a> 
    
    When you get a Maps API key, edit your `tiapp.xml` file and add your new key as the
    value for the  `ti.android.google.map.api.key.production` property.
    
    A development API key is included in the default `tiapp.xml` file. You can use this
    key for development and testing as long as you are building your application with the 
    default Titanium development keystore.
    
    #### iOS Platform Notes
    
    On iOS, you cannot call any methods on a map view until it has been added to a view.
    
    In addition to annotations, iOS supports adding routes to a map view, using
    [addRoute](Titanium.Map.View.addRoute).
    
    #### Mobile Web Platform Notes
    
    For Mobile Web, the default map provider is Google. Google Maps does not require you to obtain an API key,
    however it is encouraged that you use an API key so that you can monitor your Maps API usage. You can sign
    up for the Maps API key on the Google Code web site:
    
    * <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/signup">developers.google.com/maps/signup</a>
    
    If you get a Maps API key, edit your `tiapp.xml` file and add your new key as the
    value for the `<mobileweb><map><apikey>` tag.
    
        <mobileweb>
        	<map>
        		<apikey>[key goes here]</apikey>
        	</map>

events:

  - name: click
    summary: |
        Fired when the user selects, deselects, or clicks on an annotation.
    description: |
        Note that the `click` event is not fired every time the user clicks on the map.
        It is fired in two circumstances:

        - If the user clicks on an annotation.
        - The user deselects an annotation.

        On iOS, the user deselects an annotation by clicking in the map view outside of
        the annotation. On Android, the user deselects an annotation by clicking on the 
        annotation pin.

        The `click` event includes a value, `clicksource`, which describes the part of the 
        annotation that was clicked. Note that the possible values for `clicksource` differ between
        platforms.

        On iOS, if the user clicks on the pin or annotation, the `clicksource` is one of: 
        `pin`, `annotation`, `leftButton`, `rightButton`, `leftView`, `rightView`, 
        `title`, or `subtitle`. If the user deselects the annotation by clicking elsewhere
        in the map view, `clicksource` is `null`.

        On Android, the `clicksource` can be one of `pin`, `leftButton`,
        `rightButton`, `leftPane`, or `rightPane`. Because the user deselects an
        annotation by clicking on the pin, `clicksource` is `pin` for both 
        selection and deselection.

        On Android, no event is generated when the user clicks on the title, subtitle, or
        the background of the annotation.
