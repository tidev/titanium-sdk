summary: Represents a labeled point of interest on the map that the user can click on.

    The `Annotation` object gives you low-level control over annotations that can be added to 
    [map view](Titanium.Map.View). 

    An annotation can have a title, a subtitle, and two inset buttons or views on the left
    and right side of the title. All of these items are optional.

    The controls on the left and right side of the annotation can be specified in one of two
    ways:

    * To display an image, set the [leftButton](Titanium.Map.Annotation.leftButton) or 
      [rightButton](Titanium.Map.Annotation.rightButton) property to an image URL. (On 
      iOS, you can also use a [SystemButton](Titanium.UI.iPhone.SystemButton) constant 
      to use one of the native system button icons.) 

    * To add another type of view to the annotation, set the 
      [leftView](Titanium.Map.Annotation.leftView) or 
      [rightView](Titanium.Map.Annotation.rightView) property to a [View](Titanium.UI.View)
      object.

    `leftButton` and `leftView` are mutually exclusive, as are `rightButton` and
    `rightView`. 

    An annotation has two states: selected and deselected. A deselected annotation
    is marked by a pin image. When the user selects the pin, the full annotation is 
    displayed.

    You can specify a custom image for the map pin by setting the
    [image](Titanium.Map.Annotation.image) property. 

    When the user clicks on an annotation, a `click` event is generated. You can add a
    click event listener to a specific annotation, or add a click event listener to the 
    map view to receive click events from all annotations on the map.

    Use the <Titanium.Map.createAnnotation> method to create an annotation.

events:
  - name: click
    summary: |
        Fired when the user selects, deselects, or clicks on this annotation.
    description: |
        It is fired in two circumstances:

        - If the user clicks on an annotation.
        - The user deselects an annotation.

        On iOS, the user deselects an annotation by clicking in the map view outside of
        the annotation. On Android, the  user deselects an annotation by clicking on the 
        annotation pin.

        The `click` event includes a value, `clicksource`, which describes the part of the 
        annotation that was clicked. Note that the possible values for `clicksource` differ between
        platforms.

        On iOS, if the user clicks on the pin or annotation, the `clicksource` is one of: 
        `pin`, `annotation`, `leftButton`, `rightButton`, `leftView`, `rightView`, 
        `title`, or `subtitle`. If the user deselects the annotation by clicking elsewhere
        in the map view, `clicksource` is `null`.

        On Android, the `clicksource` can be one of `pin`, `leftButton`,
        `rightButton`, `leftPane`, or `rightPane`. Because the user deselects an
        annotation by clicking on the pin, `clicksource` is `pin` for both 
        selection and deselection.

        On Android, no event is generated when the user clicks on the title, subtitle, or
        the background of the annotation.
