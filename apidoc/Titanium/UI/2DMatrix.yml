name: Titanium.UI.2DMatrix
summary: The 2D Matrix is an object for holding values for an affine transformation matrix.
description: |
    A 2D matrix is used to rotate, scale, translate, or skew the objects in a two-dimensional space.
    A 2D affine transformation can be  represented by a 3 by 3 matrix:

    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><i>a</i></td>
          <td><i>b</i></td>
          <td>0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><i>c</i></td>
          <td><i>d</i></td>
          <td>0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><i>tx</i></td>
          <td><i>ty</i></td>
          <td>1</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    The third column is constant (0,0,1).

    On iOS, the matrix terms, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `tx`, and `ty`,
    are available as properties. On Android, the matrix terms are not available as properties.

    Use the <Titanium.UI.create2DMatrix> method to create a new 2D matrix. You can
    pass an optional <MatrixCreationDict> dictionary to the method to initialize the
    matrix. For example, the following creates a new matrix with a 45 degree rotation.

    ``` js
    var m = Ti.UI.create2DMatrix({
        rotate: 45
    });
    ```

    If you pass no arguments, `create2DMatrix` returns an identity matrix.

methods:
  - name: invert
    summary: Returns a matrix constructed by inverting this matrix.
    returns:
        type: Titanium.UI.2DMatrix
  - name: multiply
    summary: Returns a matrix constructed by combining two existing matrices.
    description: |
        The argument, `t2` is concatenated to the matrix instance against which the function is invoked. The
        resulting matrix is the result of multiplying this matrix by `t2`. You might perform several
        multiplications in order to create a single matrix that contains the cumulative effects of
        several transformations.

        Note that matrix operations are not commutative -- the order in which you concatenate matrices
        is important. That is, the result of multiplying matrix `t1` by matrix `t2` does not necessarily
        equal the result of multiplying matrix `t2` by matrix `t1`.
    returns:
        type: Titanium.UI.2DMatrix
    parameters:
      - name: t2
        summary: The second matrix.
        type: Titanium.UI.2DMatrix

  - name: rotate
    summary: Returns a matrix constructed by rotating this matrix.
    description: |
        There are two distinct versions of this method, depending on whether one argument
        or two are specified.

        *   `rotate(angle)`. The standard `rotate` method.
        *   `rotate(fromAngle, toAngle)`. Android only. Used for specifying rotation
            animations.

        In both cases, a positive value specifies clockwise rotation and a negative value
        specifies counter-clockwise rotation.

        Details for each version are discussed below.

        #### rotate(angle)

        Returns a matrix constructed by rotating this matrix.

        Note that the resulting  matrix only expresses the final transformation, not the
        direction of the rotation. For example, the matrix produced by `m1.rotate(-10)`
        is identical to the matrix produced by `m1.rotate(350)` and `m1.rotate(710)`.

        Note that if you specify a rotation matrix as the `transform` property of an
        animation, the animation animates the view from its current rotation to the
        rotation represented by the matrix by its shortest path. So to rotate a view
        in a complete circle, the easiest method is to chain together three animations,
        rotating 120 degrees each time.

        For the purposes of animation, it should be noted that the rotation angle is
        normalized to the range -180 <= angle < 180. In other
        words, an angle of 180 degrees is normalized to -180. This makes no difference
        except when determining which direction an animation rotates. 179 degrees rotates
        rotate clockwise, but 180 degrees is normalized to -180, so rotates counter-clockwise.

        #### rotate(angle, toAngle) -- Android Only

        This is an Android-specific method used for creating rotation animations.
        Returns a `2DMatrix` object that represents a rotation from `angle` to `toAngle`.

        Angles are specified in degrees. Positive values represent clockwise rotation, and negative values
        represent counter-clockwise rotation. Values are not normalized, so for example an
        angle of 720 degrees represents two complete clockwise revolutions.

        The resulting object cannot be expressed as an affine transform, but can be used with the
        <Titanium.UI.Animation.transform> property to specify a rotation animation.
    returns:
        type: Titanium.UI.2DMatrix
    parameters:
      - name: angle
        summary: |
            Angle to rotate to, in degrees. On Android, if `toAngle` is specified, this specifies
            the starting angle for a rotation animation.
        type: Number

      - name: toAngle
        summary: Ending angle for a rotation animation, in degrees. Android only.
        type: Number
        optional: true

  - name: scale
    summary: |
        Returns a `2DMatrix` object that specifies a scaling animation from one scale to another.
    description: |
        There are two distinct versions of this method, depending on whether two arguments
        or four are specified.

        *   `scale(sx, sy)`. The standard `scale` method.
        *   `scale(fromSx, fromSy, toSx, toSy)`. Android only. Used for specifying a
            scaling animation from one size to another.

        #### scale(sx, sy)

        Returns a matrix constructed by applying a scale transform to this matrix.
        Scaling the current matrix by `sx` along the X axis and by `sy` along the Y axis.

        #### scale(sx, sy, toSx, toSy) -- Android Only

        This Android-specific method returns a `2DMatrix` object that can be used to
        create a scaling animation from one scale factor to another scale factor.

        The resulting object cannot be expressed as an affine transform, but can be used with the
        <Titanium.UI.Animation.transform> property to specify a scaling animation.
    returns:
        type: Titanium.UI.2DMatrix
    parameters:
      - name: sx
        summary: |
            Horizontal scaling factor. If `toSx` and `toSy` are specified,
            this specifies the starting horizontal scaling factor, at the beginning
            of an animation.
        type: Number

      - name: sy
        summary: |
            Vertical scaling factor. If `toSx` and `toSy` are specified,
            this specifies the starting vertical scaling factor, at the beginning of
            an animation.
        type: Number

      - name: toSx
        summary: |
            Ending horizontal scaling factor, at the end of an animation.
            If specified, `toSy` must be specified as well. Android only.
        type: Number
        optional: true

      - name: toSy
        summary: |

name: MatrixCreationDict
summary: Simple object passed to <Titanium.UI.create2DMatrix> to initialize a matrix.
description: |
    The matrix is initialized with the specified transforms.

    On iOS, rotation is always performed first, regardless of the order the
    properties are specified in.

    On Android, specifying both `scale` and `rotate` the same dictionary results
    in an incorrect transformation.

properties:
  - name: scale
    summary: |

        for both horizontal and vertical scaling.
    type: Number
    optional: true
    default: 1
  - name: rotate
    summary: |
        Rotation angle, in degrees. See the [rotate](Titanium.UI.2DMatrix.rotate) method
        for a discussion of rotation.
