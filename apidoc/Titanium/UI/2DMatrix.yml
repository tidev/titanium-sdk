name: Titanium.UI.2DMatrix
summary: The 2D Matrix is an object for holding values for an affine transformation matrix.
description: |
    A 2D matrix is used to rotate, scale, translate, or skew the objects in a two-dimensional space. 
    A 2D affine transformation can be  represented by a 3 by 3 matrix:

    <table>
    <tr><td><i>a</i></td><td><i>b</i></td><td>0</td></tr>
    <tr><td><i>c</i></td><td><i>d</i></td><td>0</td></tr>
    <tr><td><i>tx</i></td><td><i>ty</i></td><td>1</td></tr>
    </table>

    The third column is constant (0,0,1). 

    On iOS, the matrix terms, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `tx`, and `ty`, are available as
    properties. On Android, the matrix terms are not available as properties. 
    
    Use the <Titanium.UI.create2DMatrix> method to create a new 2D matrix. You can 
    pass an optional <MatrixCreationDict> dictionary to the method to initialize the 
    matrix. For example:

    var m = Ti.UI.2DMatrix({ rotate: 45 });

    Produces a new matrix with a 45 degree rotation.  If you pass no arguments, 
    `create2DMatrix` returns an identity matrix.

methods:
  - name: invert
    summary: Returns a matrix constructed by inverting this matrix.
    returns:
        type: Titanium.UI.2DMatrix
  - name: multiply
    summary: Returns a matrix constructed by combining two existing matrices.
    description: |
        The argument, `t2` is concatenated to the matrix instance against which the function is invoked. The 
        resulting matrix is the result of multiplying this matrix by `t2`. You might perform several 
        multiplications in order to create a single matrix that contains the cumulative effects of 
        several transformations. 
        
        Note that matrix operations are not commutative -- the order in which you concatenate matrices 
        is important. That is, the result of multiplying matrix `t1` by matrix `t2` does not necessarily 
        equal the result of multiplying matrix `t2` by matrix `t1`.
    returns:
        type: Titanium.UI.2DMatrix
    parameters:
      - name: t2
        summary: The second matrix. 
        type: Titanium.UI.2DMatrix
  - name: rotate
    summary: Returns a matrix constructed by rotating this matrix.
    description: |
        A positive value specifies clockwise rotation and a negative value 
        specifies counter-clockwise rotation.  
        
        Note that the resulting  matrix only expresses the final transformation, not the 
        direction of the rotation. For example, the matrix produced by `m1.rotate(-10)`
        is identical to the matrix produced by `m1.rotate(350)` and `m1.rotate(710)`.

        Note that if you specify a rotation matrix as the `transform` property of an
        animation, the animation animates the view from its current rotation to the 
        rotation represented by the matrix by its shortest path. So to rotate a view 
        in a complete circle, the easiest method is to chain together three animations,
        rotating 120 degrees each time.

        For the purposes of animation, it should be noted that the rotation angle is 
        normalized to the range -180 <= angle < 180. In other 
        words, an angle of 180 degrees is normalized to -180. This makes no difference
        except when determining which direction an animation rotates. 179 degrees rotates
        rotate clockwise, but 180 degrees is normalized to -180, so rotates counter-clockwise.

        On Android, there is a second `rotate` method that takes two arguments, which can
        be used to specify rotations for animation.
    returns:
        type: Titanium.UI.2DMatrix
    parameters:
      - name: angle
        summary: Angle, in degrees, by which to rotate the matrix. 
        type: Number
  - name: rotate
    summary: |
        Returns a `2DMatrix` object that specifies a rotation animation from one angle to
        another.
    description: |
        This is an Android-specific method used for creating rotation animations.

        Angles are specified in degrees. Positive values represent clockwise rotation, and negative values
        represent counter-clockwise rotation. Values are not normalized, so for example an 
        angle of 720 degrees represents two complete clockwise revolutions.
        
        The resulting object cannot be expressed as an affine transform, but can be used with the 
        <Titanium.UI.Animation.transform> property to specify a rotation animation.
    returns:
        type: Titanium.UI.2DMatrix
    parameters:
      - name: fromAngle

name: MatrixCreationDict
summary: Simple object passed to <Titanium.UI.create2DMatrix> to initialize a matrix.
description: |
    The matrix is initialized with the specified transforms.

    On iOS, rotation is always performed first, regardless of the order the 
    properties are specified in.

    On Android, specifying both `scale` and `rotate` the same dictionary results
    in an incorrect transformation.

properties: 
  - name: scale
    summary: |

        for both horizontal and vertical scaling.
    type: Number
    optional: true
    default: 1
  - name: rotate
    summary: |
        Rotation angle, in degrees. See the [rotate](Titanium.UI.2DMatrix.rotate) method
