name: Titanium.UI.2DMatrix
description: The 2DMatrix is created by <Titanium.UI.create2DMatrix>.  The 2D Matrix is an object for holding values for an affine transformation matrix. A 2D matrix is used to rotate, scale, translate, or skew the objects in a two-dimensional space. A 2D matrix is represented by a 3 by 3 matrix. Because the third column is always (0,0,1), the data structure contains values for only the first two columns.

platforms: [android, iphone, ipad]
methods:
  - name: invert
    description: Returns a matrix constructed by inverting an existing matrix
  - name: multiply
    description: Returns a matrix constructed by combining two existing matrix.
    returns:
        type: Object
    parameters:
      - name: t2
        description: The second matrix. This matrix is concatenated to the matrix instance against which the function is invoked.  The result of this function is the first matrix multiplied by the second matrix. You might perform several multiplications in order to create a single matrix that contains the cumulative effects of several transformations. Note that matrix operations are not commutative - the order in which you concatenate matrices is important. That is, the result of multiplying matrix t1 by matrix t2 does not necessarily equal the result of multiplying matrix t2 by matrix t1.
        type: Object
  - name: rotate
    description: Returns a matrix constructed by rotating an existing matrix
    returns:
        type: Object
    parameters:
      - name: angle
        description: The angle, in degrees, by which to rotate the matrix. A positive value specifies counterclockwise rotation and a negative value specifies clockwise rotation.

    You create an `identity matrix` by creating a 2D Matrix with an empty constructor.
