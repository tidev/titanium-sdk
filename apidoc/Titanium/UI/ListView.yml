name: Titanium.UI.ListView
summary: |
    A list view is used to present information, organized in to sections and items,
    in a vertically-scrolling view.
description: |
    Use the <Titanium.UI.createListView> method to create a `ListView`.
    
    A `ListView` object is a container for [ListSection](Titanium.UI.ListSection) 
    objects that are, in turn, containers for [ListItem](Titanium.UI.ListItem) objects.

    For more instructions and examples of using `ListView`, refer to the
    [ListViews guide](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/guide/ListViews)

    #### Creating a List

    To create a list, pass an array of <ListDataItem> objects to the list section's
    [items](Titanium.UI.ListSection.items) property, which creates and adds each array
    element as a row to a single [ListSection](Titanium.UI.ListSection). Use the list view's
    [sections](Titanium.UI.ListView.sections) property to add the section(s) to the list view.

    By default, only the `image`, `title` and `accessoryType` of a list data item
    are displayed in the list. Refer to the next section for using an item template.

    See the "List View Sections" example.

    #### Customizing the List Items

    To create a custom list view, you need to define an <ItemTemplate> and define each view
    component you want to add. Use the `bindId` property of the child template to bind a dictionary
    property in the item data to a child view component.

    Map the template to a style name using the <Titanium.UI.ListView.templates> property, then use
    the style name to  set the <Titanium.UI.ListView.defaultItemTemplate> property to globally change
    all item styles or set the <ListDataItem.template> property when passing in your list data
    to apply the template to that one list item or to override the globally defined template.

    On iOS, you can specify one of the template constants for the <ListDataItem.template> property
    or <Titanium.UI.ListView.defaultItemTemplate>:
    <Titanium.UI.LIST_ITEM_TEMPLATE_CONTACTS>, <Titanium.UI.LIST_ITEM_TEMPLATE_SETTINGS>
    or <Titanium.UI.LIST_ITEM_TEMPLATE_SUBTITLE>.

    See <Titanium.UI.ListItem> for a detailed description of creating list items with a custom
    item template and see the "List View with Custom Item Template" example for a sample.

    #### List and Table Views

    This section describes the differences between the new list view and the old table view.

    `ListView` is analogous to `TableView`, `ListSection` is analogous to `TableViewSection`, and
    `ListItem` is analogous to `TableViewRow`.

    Both list view and table view present data to user as a vertically scrolling list of rows.
    However, list view uses a data-oriented approach versus table view's view-oriented approach.

    List view is designed for performance. One side effect of the design is that you cannot directly
    manipulate the views--add children, set view properties and bind event callbacks--as you can in
    `TableView`. Instead, you interact with list items indirectly, using templates and data items. The
    next subsection describes how to use list items.

    ##### ListItem versus TableViewRow

    With `TableView`, you can directly add rows to a table view using the data property and its accessors.
    With `TableViewRows`, you can directly create a row using the `Ti.UI.createTableViewRow` and customize
    its styling by setting its view properties. You can add view subcomponents to the row using the add
    method.

    With `ListView`, you need to explicitly create a `ListSection` in order to add a `ListItem` to a `ListView`.
    You cannot directly add a `ListItem` to a `ListView`.
    In a `TableView`, a `TableViewRow` can be directly added to a `TableView` because a
    `TableViewSection` is implicitly created and added to the `TableView`.

    A `ListItem` object is not created in the same method as a `TableViewRow`.
    A `ListItem` is create by passing an array of `ListDataItem` objects to the `ListSection`.

    You cannot add views to a `ListItem` using the `add` method, which could be done with a
    `TableViewRow`. To add views to a `ListItem`, you need to define an <ItemTemplate>,
    which is bound to a list data item using the `template` property.

    You cannot explicitly set properties or bind events for a `ListItem`.  You have to set them using the
    `properties` dictionary of a <ListDataItem> or <ItemTemplate> and the `events` dictionary of the
    <ItemTemplate> or <ViewTemplate>, respectively.

    ##### API Differences

    - **TableViewRow properties**: The following properties and their accessors are not
      available for `ListItem`: `accessibilityLabel`, `className`, `editable`, `hasCheck`,
      `hasChild`, `hasDetail`, `leftImage`, `moveable` and `rightImage`.

        - For `hasCheck`, `hasChild`, and `hasDetail`, use the `accessoryType` property.
        - For `leftImage` and `rightImage`, use the `image` property or create a custom item template.

    - **TableViewRow methods**: `ListItem` does not support any methods. Adding views and binding
      event callbacks are supported through the item template.

    - **TableViewSection properties**: The following properties and their accessors are not
      supported by `ListSection`: `rows` and `rowCount`.

        - For `rows`, use the `items` property.
        - For `rowCount`, use the `itemCount` property. (Not yet implemented.)

    - **TableViewSection methods**: The following methods are not supported by `ListSection`:
      `add`, `remove` and `rowAtIndex`.

        - For `rowAtIndex`, use the `getItemAt` method.
        - For `add` and `remove`, use the other `ListSection` methods to manipulate the `ListItem`
          objects in the `ListSection`.

    - **TableView properties**: The `data` property and its accessors are not available
      for `ListView`. Use the `sections` property to set the `ListSections` for a `ListView`.  You
      cannot directly add `ListItem` objects to a `ListView`.

    - **TableView methods**: The following methods are not available to `ListView`:
      `appendRow`, `deleteRow`, `deselectRow`, `insertRowAfter`, `insertRowBefore`, `selectRow`,
      `updateRow`, `scrollToIndex` and `selectRow`.

        - For `scrollToIndex`, use the `scrollToItem` method.
        - For `selectRow`, use the `selectItem` method. (Currently implemented only for iOS.)
        - For all other row methods, you cannot manipulate `ListItems` with a `ListView`.
          You have to manipulate them with the `ListSection` they are contained in.

    #### List and Scroll Views

    As a list view inherently scrolls, it creates a very poor user experience when it contains
    other scrolling views, such as a [ScrollableView](Titanium.UI.ScrollableView) or
    [TextArea](Titanium.UI.TextArea). Thus, this layout is strongly discouraged.

    #### TextFields in Lists with SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_PAN (Android)
    In order to use [TextField](Titanium.UI.TextField) inside `ListView`, [SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_PAN](Titanium.UI.Android.SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_PAN)
    must be set to the window that is containing the `ListView`, otherwise the [TextField](Titanium.UI.TextField) may not be able to gain focus.

    When a [TextField](Titanium.UI.TextField) is placed in a row near the bottom of a `ListView`,
    in a window that is configured with
    [SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_PAN](Titanium.UI.Android.SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_PAN), it is expected for the 
    text field to automatically move to a visible position after it is focused and the software
    keyboard displayed. However, due to a known problem caused by native Android's `ListView` behavior,
    the keyboard is likely to completely obscure the text field.

    To mitigate this, a `ScrollView` may be used instead of a list view, as demonstrated in the
    [ScrollView](Titanium.UI.ScrollView), "Scroll View as a Table View", example.

    #### Editing Support (iOS)

    Editing a list view through user initiated actions is supported through the following properties.

    - **ListItem properties**:

        - [canEdit](Titanium.UI.ListItem.canEdit) - When this is set to true, it allows the item to be deleted 
          from the List View through a user initiated action. The item can only be deleted when the List View is 
          in editing mode. The ListView can enter 'editing' mode either by explicitly setting the [editing](Titanium.UI.ListView.editing)
          property to true, or by swiping accross an item whose `canEdit` property is set to true. When the user
          deletes the item, a [delete](Titanium.UI.ListView.delete) event is fired.

        - [canMove](Titanium.UI.ListItem.canMove) - When this item is set to true, it allows the item to be moved
          to a different location within the List View. The item can only be moved when the List View is put in 
          editing mode by explicitly setting the [editing](Titanium.UI.ListView.editing) property to true. When the 
          user moves an item, a [move](Titanium.UI.ListView.move) event is fired.

    - **ListView properties**:

        - [editing](Titanium.UI.ListView.editing) - Determines if the List View is in a state where items can
          be deleted or reordered.

        - [pruneSectionsOnEdit](Titanium.UI.ListView.pruneSectionsOnEdit) - When this property is set to true and the 
          user action results in a section having no other items, the section is deleted from the List View. Please note 
          that this property only applies to the sections whose items are being edited.

  - title: ListView Properties as XML Elements
    example: |
        Supported in Alloy 1.3.0 and later.

        In Alloy, ListView's `searchView`, `headerView`, `footerView`, and `pullView`
        properties may be declared as XML elements inline with the `ListView` element.  The example
        below demonstrates how to use `searchView`, `headerView` and `footerView`.

            <Alloy>
                <Window fullscreen="true">
                    <ListView>
                        <!-- Sets ListView's searchView property.
                             For Android, you can also do <SearchView platform="android" />
                             to use a Ti.UI.Android.SearchView instead of a search bar. -->
                        <SearchBar barColor="#000" />

                        <!-- Sets ListView's headerView property -->
