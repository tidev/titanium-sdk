name: Titanium.UI.RefreshControl
summary: |
    The RefreshControl is a representation of the native iOS 
    [UIRefreshControl](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uirefreshcontrol) 
    and Android [SwipeRefreshLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/widget/SwipeRefreshLayout.html).
description: |

    You use a `RefreshControl` with a <Titanium.UI.TableView>, <Titanium.UI.ListView> or <Titanium.UI.ScrollView> object. 
    It provides an alternate method to implement **pull to refresh** functionality provided by 
    <Titanium.UI.TableView.headerPullView> and <Titanium.UI.ListView.pullView> properties.
    
    Use the <Titanium.UI.createRefreshControl> method to create a RefreshControl.
    
    **Important iOS 10+ Note**: If you use the RefreshControl inside a <Titanium.UI.Window> that has the `largeTitleEnabled` property
    set to `true`, you also need to set the `extendEdges` property to either `[Ti.UI.EXTEND_EDGE_TOP]` or `[Ti.UI.EXTEND_EDGE_ALL]`
    in order to prevent a flickering of the refresh spinner. In Titanium SDK 8+, the `extendEdges` property will be set to `[Ti.UI.EXTEND_EDGE_ALL]`
    by default to match the native behavior.

        in the native gray.

        A basic sample showing the usage of refreshstart event with endRefreshing functionality.

        ``` js
        var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
            fullscreen:true
        });
        var counter = 0;
        function genData()
        {
            var data = [];
            var i=1;
            for (i=1;i<=3;i++) {
                data.push({properties:{title:'ROW '+(counter+i)}})
            }
            counter += 3;
            return data;
        }
        var section = Ti.UI.createListSection();
        section.setItems(genData());
        var control = Ti.UI.createRefreshControl({
            tintColor:'red'
        })
        var listView = Ti.UI.createListView({
            sections:[section],
            refreshControl:control
        });
        control.addEventListener('refreshstart',function(e){
            Ti.API.info('refreshstart');
            setTimeout(function(){
                Ti.API.debug('Timeout');
                section.appendItems(genData());
                control.endRefreshing();
            }, 2000);
