notes: |
    the global method `alert` is aliased to this object and can be invoked with a single message. For example:
    
        alert("this is a message");
    
    Note: you should be careful not to call alert more than once while a pending alert is visible.
    
    On iOS 4, alert dialogs will automatically be cancelled upon application suspend.
