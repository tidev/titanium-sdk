name: Titanium.UI.AlertDialog
summary: |
    An alert dialog is a modal view that includes an optional title, a message and buttons, 
    positioned in the middle of the display.
description: |
    An alert dialog is created using <Titanium.UI.createAlertDialog>.
    
    Although this dialog always appears in the middle of the display (not touching the edges), 
    other aspects of its aesthetics and the way the user interacts with it are different for each 
    platform, as described below.
    
    #### Android
    
    On Android, the default alert dialog displays text information, via a title and message, without 
    any buttons. As the user can use the system hardware `back` button to dismiss it, a button is 
    optional.
    
    Buttons are shown if the `buttonNames` property is defined, and are rendered horizontally below 
    the message.
    
    To create a custom layout, a view may be added and, in turn, a hierarchy of views added to that 
    child view.
    
    #### iOS
    
    On iOS, the default alert dialog displays text information, via a title and message, with 
    a single button to allow it to be dismissed.
    
    Buttons are defined using the `buttonNames` property and are rendered vertically below 
    the message.
    
    On iOS 4, alert dialogs are automatically cancelled when the application is paused/suspended.
    
    #### Global Alias
    
    A global method `alert()` is aliased to this object, and can be invoked with a single message. 
    For example
    
        alert('this is a message');
    
    This will generate an alert with a title of "Alert" and an "OK" button.
    
    #### Caveats
    
    Multiple alerts should not be shown at once.

        In contrast, Android users may use the `back` hardware button.

    example: |
        Create a single-button alert dialog using the global `alert()` alias.
        
            Ti.UI.setBackgroundColor('white');
            var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({  
              title: 'Click window to test',
              backgroundColor: 'white',

        property, which is invoked when the app window is clicked.
        
            Ti.UI.setBackgroundColor('white');
            var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({  
              title: 'Click window to test',
              backgroundColor: 'white',
            exitOnClose: true,
            fullscreen: false
            });

            win.addEventListener('click', function(e){
              var dialog = Ti.UI.createAlertDialog({
                message: 'The file has been deleted',
                ok: 'Okay',
                title: 'File Deleted'
              }).show();
            });
            win.open();
        
  - title: Three-button Alert Dialog

        Create a three-button alert dialog, which is invoked when the app window is clicked.        
        
            Ti.UI.setBackgroundColor('white');
            var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
