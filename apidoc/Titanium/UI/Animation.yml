name: Titanium.UI.Animation
summary: The `Animation` object defines an animation that can be applied to a view.
description: |
    An animation object describes the properties of an animation. At its most basic, an animation 
    object represents a single-phase animation with an end state and a duration. 
    
    When [animate](Titanium.UI.View.animate) is called on a [View](Titanium.UI.View), the view is 
    animated from its current state to the state described by the animation object. The properties 
    that can be animated include the view's position, size, colors, transformation matrix and opacity. 
    
    Animations can be set to reverse themselves automatically on completion, and to repeat a given 
    number of times. For more complicated effects, multiple animations can be combined in sequence, 
    starting one animation when the previous animation completes.
    
    Use the <Titanium.UI.createAnimation> method to create an animation object.
    
    Note that when you animate a view's size or position, the actual layout properties (such as 
    `top`, `left`, `width`, `height`) are not changed by the animation. See the description of the 
    [animate](Titanium.UI.View.animate) method for more information.
    
    #### iOS Platform Notes
    
    iOS supports both 2D and 3D matrix transformations in animations.
    
    In iOS, you can also specify an animation curve or *easing function* to control the pace of the 
    animation. To use an easing function, set the animation's `curve` property to one of the 
    `ANIMATION_CURVE` constants defined in <Titanium.UI>. For example, 
    [ANIMATION_CURVE_EASE_IN](Titanium.UI.ANIMATION_CURVE_EASE_IN) specifies an animation that 
    starts slowly and then speeds up.
    
    Finally, iOS also supports *transitions* between windows or views. You can create a transition 
    by creating an animation object and setting the `view` property to the view you want to 
    transition to. The `transition` property specifies the transition effect to apply. Use one of 
    the transition style constants defined in <Titanium.UI.iPhone.AnimationStyle>.
    
    #### Android Platform Notes
    
    Android supports 2D matrix transformations. Note that the 
    [2DMatrix.rotate](Titanium.UI.2DMatrix.rotate) method operates differently on Android. Called 
    with a single argument, it rotates from zero to the specified angle. That is, it ignores any 
    existing rotation. Called with two arguments, it interprets the first argument as a "from" 
    angle and the second argument as a "to" angle. 
    
    Android doesn't support any animation curves or easing functions. Animations always interpolate 
    linearly between the start state and the end state.
    
    #### Mobile Web Platform Notes
    
    Mobile Web supports 2D matrix transformations and animation curves in animations.
    
    iOS 5.1 and older as well as Safari 5 have a bug where you cannot animate both a position and
    transform matrix at the same time. The matrix transform animation will override the position
    animation until the matrix transform animation is complete, then jumps to the animated position.

examples:
  - title: Simple Animation Applied to a View
    example: |
        Create a simple animation and apply it to the view.  In this example, the view will animate 
        from red to black to orange over 2 seconds.
        
            var view = Titanium.UI.createView({
              backgroundColor:'red'
            });
            var animation = Titanium.UI.createAnimation();
            animation.backgroundColor = 'black';
            animation.duration = 1000;
            var animationHandler = function() {
              animation.removeEventListener('complete',animationHandler);
              animation.backgroundColor = 'orange';
              view.animate(animation);
            };
            animation.addEventListener('complete',animationHandler);
            view.animate(animation);
    
  - title: Animation Using Matrix Transforms
    example: |
        The following example uses a transformation matrix to animate
        a view when the view is clicked. The animation rotates and scales
        the view, then returns it to its original size and position. The
        entire animation is repeated three times.
        
            var box = Ti.UI.createView({
              backgroundColor : 'red',
              height : '100',
              width : '100'
            });
            win.add(box);
            
            box.addEventListener('click', function() {
              var matrix = Ti.UI.create2DMatrix()
              matrix = matrix.rotate(180);
              matrix = matrix.scale(2, 2);
              var a = Ti.UI.createAnimation({
                transform : matrix,
                duration : 2000,
                autoreverse : true,
                repeat : 3
              });
              box.animate(a);
            });
    
  - title: Using an anchorPoint (Android and iOS)
    example: |
        Create a button and a blue square view. For each click of the button, apply a 90 degree 
        rotation animation pivoted at one of a series of anchor points. In particular, note that 
        an anchor point is configured using the <Titanium.UI.Animation.anchorPoint> property for 
        Android and the <Titanium.UI.View.anchorPoint> property for iOS.
        
            var animationType = [
              { name: 'Top Left', anchorPoint: {x:0, y:0} },

              { name: 'Bottom Left', anchorPoint: {x:0, y:1} },
              { name: 'Bottom Right', anchorPoint: {x:1, y:1} },
              { name: 'Center', anchorPoint: {x:0.5, y:0.5} }

            var t = Ti.UI.create2DMatrix();
            t = t.rotate(90);
            
            // animation properties
            var a = {
              transform: t,

              top:30
            });
            win.add(button);
            
            function updateButton(name){
              button.title = 'Animate ' + name;
            }
            
            button.addEventListener('click', function(){
              // set new anchorPoint on animation for Android
              a.anchorPoint = animationType[animationTypePointer].anchorPoint;
              
              // set new anchorPoint on view for iOS
              view.anchorPoint = animationType[animationTypePointer].anchorPoint;
              
              animationCount++;
              
              // determine position of next object in animationType array or return to first item
