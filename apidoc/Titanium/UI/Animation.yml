name: Titanium.UI.Animation
summary: The `Animation` object defines an animation that can be applied to a view.
description: |
    An animation object describes the properties of an animation. At its 
    most basic, an animation object represents a single-phase animation with an 
    end state and a duration. 
    
    When [animate](Titanium.UI.View.animate) is called on a [View](Titanium.UI.View),
    the view is animated from its current state to the state described by the 
    animation object. The properties that can be animated include the view's 
    position, size, colors, transformation matrix and opacity. 

    Animations can be set to reverse themselves automatically on completion,
    and to repeat a given number of times. For more complicated effects, 
    multiple animations can be combined in sequence, starting one animation 
    when the previous animation completes.

    Use the <Titanium.UI.createAnimation> method to create an animation object.

    Note that when you animate a view's size or position, the actual layout properties
    (such as `top`, `left`, `width`, `height`) are not changed by the animation.
    See the description of the [animate](Titanium.UI.View.animate) method for more information.

    #### iOS Platform Notes

    iOS supports both 2D and 3D matrix transformations in animations.

    In iOS, you can also specify an animation curve or *easing function* to control
    the pace of the animation. To use an easing function, set the animation's 
    `curve` property to one of the `ANIMATION_CURVE` constants defined in
    <Titanium.UI.iOS>. For example, 
    [ANIMATION_CURVE_EASE_IN](Titanium.UI.iOS.ANIMATION_CURVE_EASE_IN) specifies 
    an animation that starts slowly and then speeds up.

    Finally, iOS also supports *transitions* between windows or views. You can create a 
    transition by creating an animation object and setting the `view` property to the 
    view you want to transition to. The `transition` property specifies the transition
    effect to apply. Use one of the transition style constants defined in 
    <Titanium.UI.iPhone.AnimationStyle>.

    #### Android Platform Notes

    Android supports 2D matrix transformations. Note that the
    [2DMatrix.rotate](Titanium.UI.2DMatrix.rotate) method operates differently
    on Android. Called with a single argument, it rotates from zero to the specified 
    angle. That is, it ignores any existing rotation. Called with two arguments, 
    it interprets the first argument as a "from" angle and the second argument as a 
    "to" angle. 

    Android doesn't support any animation curves or easing functions. Animations
    always interpolate linearly between the start state and the end state.

examples:
  - title: Simple Animation Applied to a View
    example: |
        Create a simple animation and apply it to the view.  In this example, the view will animate from red to black to orange over 2 seconds.
        
            var view = Titanium.UI.createView({
               backgroundColor:'red'
            });
            var animation = Titanium.UI.createAnimation();
            animation.backgroundColor = 'black';
            animation.duration = 1000;
            var animationHandler = function() {
               animation.removeEventListener('complete',animationHandler);
               animation.backgroundColor = 'orange';
               view.animate(animation);
            };
            animation.addEventListener('complete',animationHandler);
            view.animate(animation);

  - title: Animation Using Matrix Transforms
    example: |
        The following example uses a transformation matrix to animate
        a view when the view is clicked. The animation rotates and scales
        the view, then returns it to its original size and position. The
        entire animation is repeated three times.

        	var box = Ti.UI.createView({
                backgroundColor : 'red',
                height : '100',
                width : '100'
            });
            win.add(box);
        
            box.addEventListener('click', function() {
                var matrix = Ti.UI.create2DMatrix()
                matrix = matrix.rotate(180);
                matrix = matrix.scale(2, 2);
                var a = Ti.UI.createAnimation({
                        transform : matrix,
                        duration : 2000,
                        autoreverse : true,
                        repeat : 3
                    });
                box.animate(a);
            });
