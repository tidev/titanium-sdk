name: Titanium.UI.ScrollView
summary: A view that contains a horizontally and/or vertically-scrollable region of content.
description: |
    Use the <Titanium.UI.createScrollView> method or **`<ScrollView>`** Alloy element to create a scroll view.

    Views added to the scroll view will be scrolled based on the size of the scrollable region of
    content. If a scrollable region fits within the size of its scroll view, the view will not
    scroll.

    #### Android Platform Notes

    On Android, a scroll view can only scroll in one direction, either vertically or horizontally,
    and not both at the same time. The <Titanium.UI.ScrollView.scrollType> property sets the scroll
    direction explicitly. If the `scrollType` property is not assigned a value, the scroll view
    attempts to determine the scroll direction based on some the following rules:

    * If <Titanium.UI.ScrollView.contentWidth> and <Titanium.UI.ScrollView.width> are both
    set and are equal to each other, or if they are both set
    *and* `showVerticalScrollIndicator` is set to `true`, then the scroll direction is set to
    "vertical".

    * If <Titanium.UI.ScrollView.contentHeight> and <Titanium.UI.ScrollView.height> are
    both set and are equal, or if they are both set and <Titanium.UI.ScrollView.showHorizontalScrollIndicator> is set to
    `true`, then the scroll direction is set to "horizontal".

    Pinching a `ScrollableView` to zoom in and out of content is not supported on Android. On iOS, this action
    is natively supported by the UIScrollView class, but on Android, the native ScrollView class does
    not support this action.

        type: Number

      - name: options
        summary: |
            A JS object with an `animated` property which determines whether the scrollable region reposition should be animated

            Note that the default here is equivalent to passing in `{ animated: false }`

  - name: scrollToBottom
    summary: Moves the end of the scrollable region into the viewable area.
    description: |
        On Android the behavior of `scrollToBottom` depends on whether this scroll view scrolls
        horizontally or vertically. For vertical scroll views, `scrollToBottom` moves the bottom
        of the scrollable region into the viewable area. For horizontal scroll views,
        `scrollToBottom` moves the rightmost edge of of the scrollable region into the viewable area.

        On iOS, `scrollToBottom` moves the bottom-right corner of the scrollable region into the
        viewable area.

    summary: Moves the top of the scrollable region into the viewable area.
    description: |
        On Android the behavior of `scrollToTop` depends on whether this scroll view scrolls
        horizontally or vertically. For vertical scroll views, `scrollToTop` moves the top
        of the scrollable region into the viewable area. For horizontal scroll views,

properties:
  - name: canCancelEvents
    summary: Determines whether this scroll view can cancel subview touches in order to scroll instead.
    description: |
        On iOS, this property maps to the native `canCancelContentTouches` property which controls
        whether touches in the content view always lead to tracking. See [UIScrollView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscrollview) for more details.

        On Android, setting this property to false prevents the scroll view from intercepting
        any touch events from its subviews. Note that this behavior may be slightly different from iOS.
    type: Boolean
    default: true
    platforms: [android, iphone, ipad]

  - name: contentHeight
    summary: Height of the scrollable region.
    description: |
        While absolute dimensions are supported, relative values, such as those provided
        in percentages, are not. The minimum value for contentHeight is the height of the scroll view.
        Measured in platform-specific units; pixels on Android, effective pixels on Windows and density-independent pixels (dip) on iOS.
    type: [Number, String]

  - name: contentOffset
    summary: X and Y coordinates to which to reposition the top-left point of the scrollable region.
    description: |
        On iOS, a new value causes the scroll view to perform an animated scroll to the new offset.
        The <Titanium.UI.ScrollView.setContentOffset> method can be used to prevent this animation.
    type: Point

  - name: contentWidth
    summary: Width of the scrollable region.
    description: |
        While absolute dimensions are supported, relative values, such as those provided

  - name: horizontalBounce
    summary: Determines whether horizontal scroll bounce of the scrollable region is enabled.
    description: |
        With the default value of `true`, dragging in the horizontal direction is always allowed and
        also bounces.

        Set to `false` to disable horizontal scroll bounce if the horizontal content is smaller than
        the scroll view bounds. However, larger content will still bounce when scrolled.

        Note that the `disableBounce` property takes precedence over the `horizontalBounce` and
        `verticalBounce` properties.

    summary: Controls whether the scroll-to-top gesture is effective.
    description: |
        The scroll-to-top gesture is a tap on the status bar; The default value of this property is true.
        This gesture works when you have a single visible scroll view.
        If there are multiple table views, web views, text areas, and/or scroll views visible,
        you will need to disable (set to false) on the above views that you don't want this
        behaviour on. The remaining view will then respond to scroll-to-top gesture.
