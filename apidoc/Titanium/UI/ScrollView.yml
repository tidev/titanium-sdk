name: Titanium.UI.ScrollView
description: |
    A Scroll View is used to create a scrollable region of content.  Views added to the Scroll View will be scrolled based on the content size of the Scroll View. The Scroll View is created by the method <Titanium.UI.createScrollView>. Note: In Android, Scroll Views can only scroll in one direction, either vertical or horizontal, but not both at the same time. See the <Titanium.UI.ScrollView.scrollType> property

notes: |
    If your scrollable region fits within the size of the content area the scroll view will not scroll.
    
    **Android Note**: Android ScrollViews can only scroll in one direction,
    vertical or horizontal.  We provide the `scrollType` property so you can
    explicitly set the scroll direction.  If that property is *not* set, we
    attempt to deduce the scroll direction based on some of the other
    properties that have been set.  Specifically, if `contentWidth` and `width`
    are both set and are equal to each other, or if they are both set *and*
    `showVerticalScrollIndicator` is set to `true`, then the scroll direction
    is set to "vertical".  If `contentHeight` and `height` are both set and are
    equal, or if they are both set and `showHorizontalScrollIndicator` is set
    to `true`, then the scroll direction is set to "horizontal".  If
    `scrollType` is set, it overrides the deduced setting.

    example: |
        Create a scroll view with content.
        
            var scrollView = Titanium.UI.createScrollView({
            	contentWidth:'auto',
            	contentHeight:'auto',
            	top:0,
            	showVerticalScrollIndicator:true,
            	showHorizontalScrollIndicator:true
            });
            var view = Ti.UI.createView({
            	backgroundColor:'#336699',
            	borderRadius:10,
            	width:300,
            	height:2000,
            	top:10
            });
            scrollView.add(view);
            Titanium.UI.currentWindow.add(scrollView);
