name: Titanium.UI.ScrollView
summary: |
    A Scroll View is used to create a scrollable region of content.  
description: |
    Views added to the Scroll View will be scrolled based on the content size of the 
    Scroll View. The Scroll View is created by the method <Titanium.UI.createScrollView>. 

    If your scrollable region fits within the size of the content area the scroll view will not scroll.

    #### Android Implementation Notes
    In Android, Scroll Views can only scroll in one direction, either vertical 
    or horizontal, but not both at the same time. Use the <Titanium.UI.ScrollView.scrollType> 
    property to set the scroll direction explicitly.

    
    If the `scrollType` property is *not* set, the scroll view
    attempts to deduce the scroll direction based on some of the other
    properties that have been set.  Specifically, if `contentWidth` and `width`
    are both set and are equal to each other, or if they are both set *and*
    `showVerticalScrollIndicator` is set to `true`, then the scroll direction
    is set to "vertical".  If `contentHeight` and `height` are both set and are
    equal, or if they are both set and `showHorizontalScrollIndicator` is set
    to `true`, then the scroll direction is set to "horizontal".  If
    `scrollType` is set, it overrides the deduced setting.
