summary: The main <Titanium.UI> module.  
description:  |
    The UI module is responsible for native user-interface components and interaction inside 
    Titanium.  The goal of the UI module is to provide a native experience along with native 
    performance by compiling Javascript code into their native counterparts as part of the 
    build process.
    
    #### Design
    
    The UI module is broken down into 3 major area:
    
    * **Views** - [Views](Titanium.UI.View) are containers that host visual elements such as 
    controls or other views.  Views can have their properties customized, such as their border color 
    and radius, can fire events such as swipe events or touches, and can optionally contain a 
    hierarchy or other views as children. In Titanium, most views are specialized to perform both a 
    visual function and set of interaction behaviors such as [Table View](Titanium.UI.TableView) or
    [Coverflow View](Titanium.UI.CoverFlowView).  Views are always named with the suffix `View`.
    
    * **Controls** - controls, or sometimes referred as widgets, are visual elements such as 
    [sliders](Titanium.UI.Slider),  [buttons](Titanium.UI.Button) and [switches](Titanium.UI.Switch). 
    They provide a visual element which has a defined behavior and typical have special 
    configuration and special events.  Controls themselves are views and also inherit a views 
    properties, functions and events.
    
    * **Windows** - [Windows](Titanium.UI.Window) are typically top-level visual constructs that are 
    the main part of your interface. An application will always have at least one window and windows 
    can take different shapes and sizes, can have display and interaction properties such as 
    fullscreen or modal and can be customized, such as changing their opacity or background color. 
    Windows themselves are views and also inherit a views properties, functions and events. There 
    are a few specialization of Windows such as a [Tab Group](Titanium.UI.TabGroup) which offer 
    additional behavior beyond the basic Window.
    
    Titanium uses the [Factory Pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern) for 
    constructing objects and a general naming pattern for APIs.  For example, to construct a 
    [Alert Dialog](Titanium.UI.AlertDialog), you call the method <Titanium.UI.createAlertDialog>.  
    To create a [TextArea](Titanium.UI.TextArea), you call the method <Titanium.UI.createTextArea>.  
    Once an object is created, it will be available until it goes out of scope.
    
    #### Optimizations
    
    UI objects are optimized by Titanium to not be realized into the drawing context and placed into 
    the device UI surface until needed.  That means that you can create UI objects, set their 
    properties and add them to their hierarchy without much worry about memory or performance.  
    When the native drawing surface needs to render a specific view or control, Titanium will 
    automatically create the view as needed.  Additionally, Titanium is optimized to also release 
    memory once the view is no longer needed, on screen or in low memory situations.  However, it's 
    a good idea to help Titanium along in certain cases where you are no longer using objects.  For 
    example, you should call `close` on a [Window](Titanium.UI.Window) instance when you are no 
    longer using it.  You can safely call `open` on the window again to re-open it.
    
    #### Global Context and Threading
    
    Be careful with the objects that are created in `app.js` but only used once. Since the `app.js` 
    context is global and generally is not garbage collected until the application exits, you 
    should think about the design of your application as it relates to this fact.
    
    [Window](Titanium.UI.Window) objects that are opened up with the `url` property to another 
    JavaScript file provide a nice way to decompose your application into smaller units.
    
    Additionally, Window objects created with a `url` value run in a separate JavaScript context 
    and thread. While all UI processing is done on the main UI thread, other processing inside 
    a Window or the `app.js` that does not have UI interaction will run in its own thread.
    
    The other benefit of using the `url` property is that when the window is closed, resources 
    allocated in the window's context can be immediately cleaned up, saving resources such as 
    memory and CPU.
    
    For more information, see the sections "Sub-contexts" and "Passing Data Between Contexts" on the 
    [Window](Titanium.UI.Window) reference page.
    
    #### Portability
    
    Titanium components are designed to be portable across as many platforms as it supports.  
    However, there are cases where a device either does not support a specific feature or capability 
    or where it support additional functionality.  For cases where the device OS supports 
    capabilities that other platforms do not, we attempt to place those capabilities in a separate 
    namespace, such as <Titanium.UI.iPhone>. However, in cases where the control is in a common 
    namespace and support additional features, we continue to place that functionality directly on 
    the object.
    
    #### Events
    
    Event listeners must be defined before their respective events are likely to be fired, otherwise 
    they are not guaranteed to be called. The open and focus [Window](Titanium.UI.Window) event 
    listeners, for instance, must be defined before the window is opened.
    
    Evaluating events as late as possible while bearing the above consideration in mind, however, 
    can significantly improve application responsiveness. For example, an event listener for a 
    click event may be defined after the parent window has been opened.
    
    #### Colors
    
    Many UI components have properties that control their color.
    
    Colors may be specified as a hex triplet to determine the red, green and blue channels. Thus, 
    `'#000000'` is specified for black, `'#ff0000'` for red, `'#00ff00'` for green, `'#0000ff'` for blue, 
    and `'#ffffff'` for white, etc. A channel may be abbreviated when its two hex digits are identical, 
    such as `'#000'`, `'#f00'`, `'#0f0#'`, `'#00f'` and `'#fff'` for the above colors, respectively.
    
    On iOS, an additional alpha channel is supported as a prefix to the hex triplet. So, to make 
    the purple-like color `'#ff00ff'` semi-opaque, you could use an alpha value of `'55'`, giving, 
    `'#55ff00ff'` or `'#5f0f'`.
    
    iOS also accepts colors specified in the form, `(red,green,blue)` and `(red,green,blue,alpha)`, 
    with the color channels represented by integers between `0` and `255` and the alpha channel by 
    a float between `0` and `1.0` and . For example, an opaque purple could be obtained using 
    `'(255,0,255)'` and a semi-opaque purple using `'(255,0,255,0.3)'`.
    
    Alternatively, the following set of color names are recognized.
    
    `'aqua'`, `'black'`, `'blue'`, `'brown'`, `'cyan'`, `'darkgray'`, `'fuchsia'`, `'gray'`, 
    `'green'`, `'lightgray'`, `'lime'`, `'magenta'`, `'maroon'`, `'navy'`, `'olive'`, `'orange'`, 
    `'pink'`, `'purple'`, `'red'`, `'silver'`, `'teal'`, `'white'`, `'yellow'`.
    
    Note that, currently, Android does not support the color name `'brown'` and iOS does not support 
    `'aqua'`, `'fuchsia'`, `'lime'` or `'maroon'`
    
    All color properties also accept a value of `'transparent'`.
    
    If a color name is not recognized or is not specified for a property, the default color of the 
    particular UI element is applied.
    
    Note that while the pound symbol is not mandatory on iOS when using the hex triplet format, it 
    is recommended to provide compatibility with other platforms.
