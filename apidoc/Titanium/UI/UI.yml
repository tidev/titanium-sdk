name: Titanium.UI
summary: The main <Titanium.UI> module.  
description:  |
    The UI module is responsible for native user-interface components and interaction inside 
    Titanium.  The goal of the UI module is to provide a native experience along with native 
    performance by compiling Javascript code into their native counterparts as part of the 
    build process.

    #### Design
    
    The UI module is broken down into 3 major area:

    * **Views** - [Views](Titanium.UI.View-object.html) are containers that
    host visual elements such as controls or other views.  Views can have
    their properties customized, such as their border color and radius, can
    fire events such as swipe events or touches, and can optionally contain a
    hierarchy or other views as children. In Titanium, most views are
    specialized to perform both a visual function and set of interaction
    behaviors such as [Table View](Titanium.UI.TableView-object.html) or
    [Coverflow View](Titanium.UI.CoverFlowView-object.html).  Views are always
    named with the suffix `View`.

    * **Controls** - controls, or sometimes referred as widgets, are visual
    elements such as [sliders](Titanium.UI.Slider-object.html),
    [buttons](Titanium.UI.Button-object.html) and
    [switches](Titanium.UI.Switch-object.html). They provide a visual element
    which has a defined behavior and typical have special configuration and
    special events.  Controls themselves are views and also inherit a views
    properties, functions and events.

    * **Windows** - [Windows](Titanium.UI.Window-object.html) are typically
    top-level visual constructs that are the main part of your interface. An
    application will always have at least one window and windows can take
    different shapes and sizes, can have display and interaction properties
    such as fullscreen or modal and can be customized, such as changing their
    opacity or background color. Windows themselves are views and also inherit
    a views properties, functions and events. There are a few specialization
    of Windows such as a [Tab Group](Titanium.UI.TabGroup-object.html) which
    offer additional behavior beyond the basic Window.


    Titanium uses the [Factory
    Pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern) for
    constructing objects and a general naming pattern for APIs.  For example,
    to construct a [Alert Dialog](Titanium.UI.AlertDialog-object.html), you
    call the method <Titanium.UI.createAlertDialog>.  To create a
    [TextArea](Titanium.UI.TextArea-object.html), you call the method
    <Titanium.UI.createTextArea>.  Once an object is created, it will be
    available until it goes out of scope.

    #### Optimizations

    UI objects are optimized by Titanium to not be realized into the drawing
    context and placed into the device UI surface until needed.  That means that
    you can create UI objects, set their properties and add them to their
    hierarchy without much worry about memory or performance.  When the native
    drawing surface needs to render a specific view or control, Titanium will
    automatically create the view as needed.  Additionally, Titanium is
    optimized to also release memory once the view is no longer needed, on
    screen or in low memory situations.  However, it's a good idea to help
    Titanium along in certain cases where you are no longer using objects.  For
    example, you should call `close` on a
    [Window](Titanium.UI.Window-object.html) instance when you are no longer
    using it.  You can safely call `open` on the window again to re-open it.

    #### Global Context and Threading

    Be careful with the objects that are created in `app.js` but only used once.
    Since the `app.js` context is global and generally is not garbage collected
    until the application exits, you should think about the design of your
    application as it relates to this fact.

    [Window](Titanium.UI.Window-object.html) objects that are opened up with the
    `url` property to another JavaScript file provide a nice way to decompose
    your application into smaller units. 
    
    Additionally, Window objects created with a `url` value run in a
    separate JavaScript context and thread. While all UI processing is done on
    the main UI thread, other processing inside a Window or the `app.js` that
    does not have UI interaction will run in its own thread.

    The other benefit of using the `url` property is that when the
    window is closed, resources allocated in the window's context can be
    immediately cleaned up, saving resources such as memory and CPU.

    For more information, see the sections "Sub-contexts" and "Passing Data Between Contexts"
    on the [Window](Titanium.UI.Window) reference page.

    #### Portability
    
    Titanium components are designed to be portable across as many platforms as
    it supports.  However, there are cases where a device either does not
    support a specific feature or capability or where it support additional
    functionality.  For cases where the device OS supports capabilities that
    other platforms do not, we attempt to place those capabilities in a separate
    namespace, such as <Titanium.UI.iPhone>.
    However, in cases where the control is in a common namespace and support
    additional features, we continue to place that functionality directly on the
    object.
    
    #### Events
    
    Event listeners must be defined before their respective events are likely to 
    be fired, otherwise they are not guaranteed to be called. The open and focus 
    [Window](Titanium.UI.Window-object.html) event listeners, for instance, must 
    be defined before the window is opened.

    Evaluating events as late as possible while bearing the above consideration 
    in mind, however, can significantly improve application responsiveness. For 
    example, an event listener for a click event may be defined after the parent 
    window has been opened.
