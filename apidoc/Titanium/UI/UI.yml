name: Titanium.UI
summary: The main <Titanium.UI> module.
description:  |
    The UI module is responsible for native user-interface components and interaction inside
    Titanium.  The goal of the UI module is to provide a native experience along with native
    performance by compiling Javascript code into their native counterparts as part of the
    build process.

    #### Design

    The UI module is broken down into 3 major area:

    * **Views** - [Views](Titanium.UI.View) are containers that host visual elements such as
    controls or other views.  Views can have their properties customized, such as their border color
    and radius, can fire events such as swipe events or touches, and can optionally contain a
    hierarchy or other views as children. In Titanium, most views are specialized to perform both a
    visual function and set of interaction behaviors such as [Table View](Titanium.UI.TableView) or
    [Coverflow View](Titanium.UI.iOS.CoverFlowView).  Views are always named with the suffix `View`.

    * **Controls** - controls, or sometimes referred as widgets, are visual elements such as
    [sliders](Titanium.UI.Slider),  [buttons](Titanium.UI.Button) and [switches](Titanium.UI.Switch).
    They provide a visual element which has a defined behavior and typical have special
    configuration and special events.  Controls themselves are views and also inherit a views
    properties, functions and events.

    * **Windows** - [Windows](Titanium.UI.Window) are typically top-level visual constructs that are
    the main part of your interface. An application will always have at least one window and windows
    can take different shapes and sizes, can have display and interaction properties such as
    fullscreen or modal and can be customized, such as changing their opacity or background color.
    Windows themselves are views and also inherit a views properties, functions and events. There
    are a few specialization of Windows such as a [Tab Group](Titanium.UI.TabGroup) which offer
    additional behavior beyond the basic Window.

    Titanium uses the [Factory Pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern) for
    constructing objects and a general naming pattern for APIs.  For example, to construct a
    [Alert Dialog](Titanium.UI.AlertDialog), you call the method <Titanium.UI.createAlertDialog>.
    To create a [TextArea](Titanium.UI.TextArea), you call the method <Titanium.UI.createTextArea>.
    Once an object is created, it will be available until it goes out of scope.

    #### Optimizations

    UI objects are optimized by Titanium to not be realized into the drawing context and placed into
    the device UI surface until needed.  That means that you can create UI objects, set their
    properties and add them to their hierarchy without much worry about memory or performance.
    When the native drawing surface needs to render a specific view or control, Titanium will
    automatically create the view as needed.  Additionally, Titanium is optimized to also release
    memory once the view is no longer needed, on screen or in low memory situations.  However, it's
    a good idea to help Titanium along in certain cases where you are no longer using objects.  For
    example, you should call `close` on a [Window](Titanium.UI.Window) instance when you are no
    longer using it.  You can safely call `open` on the window again to re-open it.

    #### Global Context and Threading

    Be careful with the objects that are created in `app.js` but only used once. Since the `app.js`
    context is global and generally is not garbage collected until the application exits, you
    should think about the design of your application as it relates to this fact.

    [Window](Titanium.UI.Window) objects that are opened up with the `url` property to another
    JavaScript file provide a nice way to decompose your application into smaller units.

    Additionally, Window objects created with a `url` value run in a separate JavaScript context
    and thread. While all UI processing is done on the main UI thread, other processing inside
    a Window or the `app.js` that does not have UI interaction will run in its own thread.

    The other benefit of using the `url` property is that when the window is closed, resources
    allocated in the window's context can be immediately cleaned up, saving resources such as
    memory and CPU.

    For more information, see the sections "Sub-contexts" and "Passing Data Between Contexts" on the
    [Window](Titanium.UI.Window) reference page.

    #### Portability

    Titanium components are designed to be portable across as many platforms as it supports.
    However, there are cases where a device either does not support a specific feature or capability
    or where it support additional functionality.  For cases where the device OS supports
    capabilities that other platforms do not, we attempt to place those capabilities in a separate
    namespace, such as <Titanium.UI.iPhone>. However, in cases where the control is in a common
    namespace and support additional features, we continue to place that functionality directly on
    the object.

    #### Events

    Event listeners must be defined before their respective events are likely to be fired, otherwise
    they are not guaranteed to be called. The open and focus [Window](Titanium.UI.Window) event
    listeners, for instance, must be defined before the window is opened.

    Evaluating events as late as possible while bearing the above consideration in mind, however,
    can significantly improve application responsiveness. For example, an event listener for a
    click event may be defined after the parent window has been opened.

    #### Colors

    Many UI components have properties that control their color.

    Colors may be specified as a hex triplet to determine the red, green and blue channels. Thus,
    `'#000000'` is specified for black, `'#ff0000'` for red, `'#00ff00'` for green, `'#0000ff'` for
    blue, and `'#ffffff'` for white, etc. A channel may be abbreviated when its two hex digits are
    identical, such as `'#000'`, `'#f00'`, `'#0f0#'`, `'#00f'` and `'#fff'` for the above colors,
    respectively.

    An additional alpha channel is supported as a prefix to the hex triplet. So, to make
    the purple-like color `'#ff00ff'` semi-opaque, you could use an alpha value of `'55'`, giving,
    `'#55ff00ff'` or `'#5f0f'`.

    Note that while the pound symbol, `#`, is not mandatory on iOS when using the hex triplet format,
    it is recommended to include it to provide compatibility with other platforms.

    iOS also accepts colors specified in the form, `rgb(R,G,B)` and `rgba(R,G,B,A)`, with the color
    channels inside the parethesis represented by integer numbers between `0` and `255` and the
    alpha channel by a float number between `0` and `1.0` (transparent to opaque, respectively).
    For example, an opaque purple could be obtained using `'rgb(255,0,255)'` and a semi-opaque purple
    using `'rgba(255,0,255,0.3)'`. Note that although this format will work if the `rgb` or `rgba`
    prefix is omitted, this is not officially supported and thus not recommended.

    Alternatively, the following set of color names are recognized.

    `'aqua'`, `'black'`, `'blue'`, `'brown'`, `'cyan'`, `'darkgray'`, `'fuchsia'`, `'gray'`,
    `'green'`, `'lightgray'`, `'lime'`, `'magenta'`, `'maroon'`, `'navy'`, `'olive'`, `'orange'`,
    `'pink'`, `'purple'`, `'red'`, `'silver'`, `'teal'`, `'white'`, `'yellow'`.

    All color properties also accept a value of `'transparent'`.

    On Android, if you want to create a semi-transparent window, set the `opacity`
    property **before** opening the window.

    On iOS, you can set a global tinting using <Titanium.UI.tintColor>. All child views will inherit
    the tint color by default and are able to override the color using `tintColor` on their own views.
    The default `tintColor` on iOS is the blue (system-color).

    If a color property is undefined, the default color of the particular UI element is applied.
    If a color value is not valid on iOS, the default color is applied, whereas, on Android, the
    color yellow is applied.

    #### Dark Mode

    In iOS 13 Apple introduced support for users to adopt a system-wide Dark Mode setting where the screens, view, menus, and controls use a darker color palette. You can read more about this in the Apple Human Interface Guidelines.

    There are two aspects to dark mode that can be specified for your app, colors and images.

    ##### Specifying Dark Mode colors

    To specify colors for dark mode, also known as semantic colors, first create a file called `semantic.colors.json` in the Resources directory for classic applications, or in the assets directory for Alloy applications. Then you can specify color names in the following format:

    ``` json
      {
        "textColor": { // the name for your color
          "dark": {
            "color": "#ff85e2", // hex color code to be set
            "alpha": "50.0" // can be set from a range of 0-100
          },
          "light": "#ff1f1f"
        }
      }
    ```

    To reference these colors in your application use the <Titanium.UI.fetchSemanticColor> API, this is a cross platform API that on iOS 13 and above will use the native method that checks the users system-wide setting, and in all other instances will check the <Titanium.UI.semanticColorType> property and return the correct color for the current setting.

    ##### Specifying Dark Mode images

    Note: Dark Mode images are iOS only.

    To specify dark mode images, use the `-dark` suffix on the image name. When building your app the images are set as the dark mode variant, then refer to images as normal and iOS will select the correct image dependent on the users system-wide setting.

    For example given an image `logo.png` with `@2x` and `@3x` variants, the following dark mode images should exist:

      * logo-dark.png
      * logo-dark@2x.png
      * logo-dark@3x.png

    And you would reference the image as before using `logo-dark.png`
