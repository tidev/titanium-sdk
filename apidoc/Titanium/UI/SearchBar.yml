name: Titanium.UI.SearchBar
summary: A specialized text field for entering search text.
description: |
    The `SearchBar` object is closely modeled on an iOS native search bar.
    As such, not all features are supported on other platforms.
    
    Search bars are most commonly used for filtering the rows in a [TableView](Titanium.UI.TableView).
    You can add a search bar to a table view by setting the table view's 
    [search](Titanium.UI.TableView.search) property. 

    A search bar can also be used without a table view.

    Use the <Titanium.UI.createSearchBar> method to create a search bar.

    #### Android Platform Implementation Notes

    On Android, there are several issues with the current implementation:

    * The cancel button does not work. It does not clear the search bar text or 
      close the onscreen keyboard.

    * Calling the `blur` method on the search bar closes the onscreen keyboard, 
      but the search bar retains its focused appearance.

    * The search bar does not lose focus when the user clicks on a row in the search
      results.

    To use a search bar on Android, you may need to explicitly control the focus and
    clearing of the search bar, depending on your desired behavior. For example, to clear
    the search bar and dismiss the onscreen keyboard when the user selects a row, you
    could add code like this to the `click` event handler on your table view:
        
        myTableView.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
            if (Ti.Platform.name === 'android') {
                // Clear search bar
                mySearchBar.value ="";
                // hiding and showing the search bar forces it back to its non-focused appearance.
                mySearchBar.hide();
                mySearchBar.blur();
                mySearchBar.show();
            }
            // standard click event handling here
