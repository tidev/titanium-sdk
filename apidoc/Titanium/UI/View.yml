    The `View` is the base type for all UI widgets in Titanium.

    
    #### Units and Coordinates
    
    Sizes and coordinates can be specified using a variety of units. If a value is
    specified as a number, it is interpreted as a value in the default unit for the
    current system and/or the current project.

    When a value is specified as string, the value can consist of:
    
    *  A number.
    *  A percentage, such as "10%", interpreted as a percentage of the parent's total size
       in that dimension.
    *  A number plus a unit specifier, such as "10px" or "1in". 
    
    The following units are supported:
    
    <table cellpadding="6px" border="1" rules="all">
    <tr>
    <th align="left">Unit</th> <th align="left">Specifier</th> <th align="left">Note<th>
    </tr>
    <tr> <td>pixels</td> <td>px</td> <td></td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>density-independent pixels</td> <td>dip</td> <td>Equivalent to Apple "points."</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>inches</td> <td>in</td> <td></td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>millimeters</td> <td>mm</td> <td>Android, iOS only</td>  </tr>
    <tr> <td>centimeters</td> <td>cm</td> <td>Android, iOS only</td>  </tr>
    <tr> <td>points</td> <td>pt</td> 
         <td>Typographical points of 1/72 of an inch. On Android, you can specify sizes and 
         coordinates in typographical points. On other platforms, this unit is only used
         to specify font sizes.  Not to be confused with Apple "points."</td> </tr>
    </table>

    The interpretation of the density-independent pixel (DIP) varies by platform:

    *   On Android, one DIP corresponds to one pixel on a 160DPI
        display.
    
    *   On iOS, one DIP corresponds to one pixel on a non-Retina display, which
        is 163DPI for iPhone/iPod touch and 132DPI for the iPad. A DIP
        corresponds to 2 pixels of width or height on a Retina display.
    
    *   On Mobile Web, both DIP and pixel are equal to one browser pixel, which may
        not correspond to a pixel on the display. From testing, most browsers seem to
        report a DPI value of 96DPI, regardless of the actual display density.
    
    The absolute measures, such as inches, are dependent on the device correctly reporting
    its density. On Mobile Web, in particular, these values are unlikely to be exact.
    
    If no units are specified, a system-default unit is assumed. The system default unit is:
    
    *    Pixels on Android.
    *    DIPs on iOS.
    *    DIPs on Mobile Web (as described above, DIPs and pixels are interchangable on
         Mobile Web).

    Note that prior to Release 2.0, iOS ignored any specified unit, so code that specifies
    a unit may operate differently on iOS in Release 2.0.

    Font sizes on iOS are treated differently than other sizes: font sizes are always 
    specified in typographical points. 

    The [height](Titanium.UI.View.height) and [width](Titanium.UI.View.width) properties 
    accept several special values:

    *   <Titanium.UI.FILL> specifies that the view should fill the parent in this
        dimension.
    *   <Titanium.UI.SIZE> specifies that the view should adjust this size to fit its
        contents, such as a label's text or a view's children.
    *   'auto' specifies that the view should choose either `FILL` or `SIZE` behavior.
        In 2.0, the behavior of the 'auto' value is specified by the UI Composite Layout
        Spec. This value is not recommended for new development and will be deprecated in
        the future.
    
    Sizes and positions can also be specified as a percentage of the parent's size, for 
    example, '50%'.
    
    For more details see: 

    * [UI Composite Layout Spec](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/2.0/index.html#!/guide/UI_Composite_Layout_Behavior_Spec)

    #### Size and Position
    
    Titanium views are positioned using the `left`, `right`, `top,` `bottom` and `center` 
    properties, and sized using the `width` and `height` properties. These are
    input properties, set by the user to specify layout, and not modified by the 
    system to indicate actual calculated positions and sizes. 
    
    How these properties are interpreted depends on the value of the view's `layout` 
    property. See the description of the [layout](Titanium.UI.View.layout) property 
    for details.
    
    The [size](Titanium.UI.View.size) property is a read-only dimension
    with the properties `x`, `y`, `width` and `height`. It provides the *rendered* size
     of the  view, and is only available once both it and its ancestors have been
    fully drawn.

    The [rect](Titanium.UI.View.rect) property is a read-only dimension
    with the properties `x`, `y`, `width` and `height`. It provides the *rendered*
    position and size of the  view, and is only available once both it and its ancestors have been
    fully drawn.

    To determine whether the `size` and `rect` values are available, add an event listener
    for the [postlayout](Titanium.UI.View.postlayout) event, which is fired at the end of
    a layout cycle.

methods:
  - name: add
    summary: Adds a child to this view's hierarchy.
    description: |
        There are certain top-level containers that are not intended to be added 
        as the children of other views. These top-level containers include 
        [Window](Titanium.UI.Window), [SplitWindow](Titanium.UI.iPad.SplitWindow),
        and [TabGroup](Titanium.UI.TabGroup).  Other types of views must be added 
        to a top-level container in order to be displayed on screen.

        The special containers [NavigationGroup](Titanium.UI.iPhone.NavigationGroup), 
        [SplitWindow](Titanium.UI.iPad.SplitWindow), [Tab](Titanium.UI.Tab), and 
        [TabGroup](Titanium.UI.TabGroup)
        manage windows. These managed windows may be referred to as *children* of the 
        container, but they are not added using the `add` method.
        
        Note that although a `NavigationGroup`
        manages windows, it is not itself top-level container.  It must be added to a 
        `Window` in order to be displayed. 
        
        `Tab` is another kind of special container: it is not itself a top-level container, 
        but can only be used within a `TabGroup`. You cannot `add` a `Tab` to an arbitrary
        container.
    parameters:
      - name: view
        summary: View to add to this view's hierarchy.
        type: Titanium.UI.View
        
  - name: animate
    summary: Animates this view.
    description: |
        The [Animation](Titanium.UI.Animation) object or dictionary passed to this
        method defines the end state for the animation, the duration of the animation,
        and other properties.

        Note that if you use `animate` to move a view, the view's actual *position*
        is changed, but its layout properties, such as `top`, `left`, `center` and 
        so on are not changed--these reflect the original values set by the user, not
        the actual position of the view.
        
        In this release, the view's actual position is not available to the application. 
        This feature will be added to a future release.

        If you need one or more of the layout  properties to be updated after animation,
        you can update them in the callback after animation is complete. For example:

            var newTop = view1.top - 100;
            view1.animate({ top: newTop, duration: 500 }, function () {
                view.top = newTop; 
            });
    parameters:
      - name: obj
        summary: |
            Either a dictionary of animation properties or an 
            [Animation](Titanium.UI.Animation) object.
        type: [Titanium.UI.Animation,Dictionary<Titanium.UI.Animation>]
      - name: callback
        summary: Function to be invoked upon completion of the animation.
        type: Callback<Object>

  - name: finishLayout
    since: "2.0.0"
    summary: |
        Finishes a batch update of the View's layout properties and schedules a layout pass of the view tree.
    description: |
        Since the layout pass scheduled is asynchronous, the [rect](Titanium.UI.View.rect)
        and [size](Titanium.UI.View.size) values may not be available immediately after `finishLayout` 
        is called. 
        
        To be notified when the layout pass completes, add a listener for the
        [postlayout](Titanium.UI.View.postlayout) event.
  - name: hide
    summary: Hides this view.
    
  - name: remove
    summary: Removes a child view from this view's hierarchy.
    parameters:
      - name: view
        summary: View to remove from this view's hierarchy.
        type: Titanium.UI.View
    
  - name: show
    summary: Makes this view visible.

  - name: startLayout
    since: "2.0.0"
    summary: Starts a batch update of this view's layout properties.
    description: |
        To prevent a layout pass each time a property is modified, call
        `startLayout` before changing any properties that may change this
        view's layout. This initiates a batch update mode where layout
        changes are deferred.

        Call [finishLayout](Titanium.UI.View.finishLayout) to end 
        batch update mode and trigger a layout pass. For example:

            view.startLayout();
            view.top = 50;
            view.left = 50;
            view.finishLayout();
        
        Note that _any_ property changes made during the batch update _may_ be deferred until
        `finishLayout` is called. This may vary somewhat by platform. For example, changing the
        text of a label may trigger a layout pass. In iOS, updating the label text is
        deferred, while on Mobile Web, the label text is updated immediately but the control is 
        not resized until `finishLayout` is called.

    summary: Returns an image of the rendered view, as a Blob.
    platforms: [android, iphone, ipad]
    returns:
        type: Titanium.Blob
    parameters:
      - name: f
        summary: | 
            Function to be invoked upon completion. If non-null, this method will be

    summary: Returns an image of the rendered view, as a Blob.
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
    returns:
        type: Titanium.Blob
    parameters:
      - name: f
        summary: | 
            Function to be invoked upon completion. If non-null, this method will be 
            performed asynchronously. If null, it will be performed immediately.
        type: Callback<Object>
        optional: true
      - name: honorScaleFactor
        summary: | 
            When set to true, the image is scaled based on scale factor of main screen.
            When set to false the image in the blob has the same dimensions for retina and non retina devices.
        type: Boolean
        optional: true

  - name: updateLayout
    since: "2.0.0"
    summary: |
        Performs a batch update of all supplied layout properties and schedules a
        layout pass after they have been updated.
    parameters:
      - name: params
        summary: |
          Dictionary of layout properties to be updated.
        type: Object
    description: |
        This is another way to perform a batch update.  The `updateLayout` method is
        called with a dictionary of layout properties to perform the batch update. For
        example:

            view.updateLayout({top:50, left:50});

        This is equivalent to the following:

            view.startLayout();
            view.top = 50;
            view.left = 50;
            view.finishLayout();

  - name: convertPointToView
    summary: |
        Translates a point from this view's coordinate system to another 
        view's coordinate system.
    description: |
        If both views are connected in the native view hierarchies, returns the 
        point, converted to `destinationView`'s coordinate system.

        Returns `null` if either view is not in the view hierarchy.
        Keep in mind that views may be removed from the view hierarchy if their window 
        is blurred or if the view is offscreen (such as in some situations with 
        <Titanium.UI.ScrollableView>).

        If this view is a <Titanium.UI.ScrollView>, the view's x and y offsets are 
        subtracted from the return value.
    platforms: [android, iphone, ipad]
    returns:
        type: Point
    parameters:
      - name: point
        summary: |
            A point in this view's coordinate system.  
            If this argument is missing an `x` or `y` property, or the properties can not 
            be converted into numbers, an exception will be raised.
        type: Point
      - name: destinationView
        summary: |
            View that specifies the destination coordinate system to convert to.
            If this argument is not a view, an exception will be raised.
        type: Titanium.UI.View

events:
  - name: click
    summary: Fired when the device detects a click against the view.
    description: |
        There is a subtle difference between singletap and click events.

        A singletap event is generated when the user taps the screen briefly
        without moving their finger. This gesture will also generate a click event.

        However, a click event can also be generated when the user touches, 
        moves their finger, and then removes it from the screen.

        On Android, a click event can also be generated by a trackball click.
    properties:
      - name: y
        summary: Y coordinate of the event from the `source` view's coordinate system.
        type: Number
      - name: globalPoint
        summary: |

        type: Number
    
  - name: longclick
    summary: Fired when the device detects a long click.
    description: |
        A long click is generated by touching and holding on the touchscreen or holding down the 
        trackball button.  
        
        The event occurs before the finger/button is lifted.  
        
        A `longpress` and a `longclick` can occur together.  
        
        As the trackball can fire this event, it is not intended to return the `x` and `y` 
        coordinates of the touch, even when it is generated by the touchscreen.  
        
        A `longclick` blocks a `click`, meaning that a `click` event will not fire when a 
        `longclick` listener exists.
    platforms: [android]
    
  - name: longpress
    summary: Fired when the device detects a long press.
    description: |
        A long press is generated by touching and holding on the touchscreen. Unlike a `longclick`, 
        it does not respond to the trackball button.  
        
        The event occurs before the finger is lifted.   
        
        A `longpress` and a `longclick` can occur together.  
        
        In contrast to a `longclick`, this event returns the `x` and `y` coordinates of the touch.
    properties:
      - name: y
        summary: Y coordinate of the event from the `source` view's coordinate system.
        type: Number

  - name: pinch
    summary: Fired when the device detects a pinch gesture.
    description: |
        A pinch is a touch and expand or contract 
        with two fingers.  The event occurs continuously until a finger is lifted again.  
    properties:
      - name: scale
        summary: The scale factor relative to the points of the two touches in screen coordinates.

  - name: postlayout
    summary: Fired when a layout cycle is finished.
    description: |
        This event is fired when the view and its ancestors have been laid out.
        The [rect](Titanium.UI.View.rect) and [size](Titanium.UI.View.size) values 
        should be usable when this event is fired.

        This event is typically triggered by either changing layout
        properties or by changing the orientation of the device. Note that changing the 
        layout of child views or ancestors can also trigger a relayout of this view.
        On Mobile Web, this event can also be triggered by resizing the browser window.

        Note that altering any properties that affect layout from the `postlayout` callback 
        may result in an endless loop.

    type: String
    
  - name: backgroundGradient
    summary: A background gradient for the view.
    type: Gradient
    platforms: [iphone,ipad,mobileweb]
    description: |
        A gradient can be defined as either linear or radial. A linear gradient
        varies continuously along a line between the `startPoint` and `endPoint`.
        A radial gradient is interpolated between two circles, defined by `startPoint`
        and `startRadius` and `endPoint` and `endRadius` respectively.

        The start and end points and radius values can be defined in device units,
        in the view's coordinates, or as percentages of the view's size. Thus, if
        a view is 60 x 60, the center point of the view can be specified as:

            { x: 30, y: 30 }
        Or:
            { x: '50%', y: '50%' }

        When specifying multiple colors, you can specify an *offset* value for
        each color, defining how far into the gradient it takes effect. For example,
        the following color array specifies a gradient that goes from red to blue back to red:

            colors: [ { color: 'red', offset: 0.0}, { color: 'blue', offset: 0.25 }, { color: 'red', offset: 1.0 } ]
            
        Mobile Web has two limitations: backfillStart and backfillEnd are ignored and the system behaves as if they 
        are true, and endPoint is not supported for radial gradients. 
    examples:
      - title: Linear and Radial Gradients
        example: |
            The following code excerpt creates two views, one with a linear gradient and one with

    description: |
        Setting this to `true` makes the set `backgroundImage` repeat across
        the view as a series of tiles. The tiling is begins in the upper-left
        corner, where the upper-left corner of the background image is rendered.
        The image is then tiled to fill the available space of the view.
        
        Note that setting this to `true` may incur performance penalties for
        large views or background images, as the tiling must be redone
        whenever a view is resized.

        End caps specify the portion of an image that should not be resized when an

        resizable image-based interface elements. When a button with end caps is resized, 
        the resizing occurs only in the middle of the button, in the region between the end 
        caps. The end caps themselves keep their original size and appearance. This property 
        specifies the size of the left end cap. The middle (stretchable) portion is assumed to 
        be 1 pixel wide. The right end cap is therefore computed by adding the size of the left 
        end cap and the middle portion together and then subtracting that value from the width

  - name: layout
    type: String
    summary: |
        Specifies how the view positions its children. 
        One of: 'absolute', 'vertical', or 'horizontal'.
    description: |
        There are three layout options:

        *   `absolute`. Default layout. A child view's `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` 
            properties are interpreted as absolute values in the parent's coordinate space.

            If the child includes a `top` value and **not** a `bottom` value, the child is 
            positioned `top` units from the top of the parent's bounding box, and its height
            is set based on its `height` property.

            If the child includes a `bottom` value and **not** a `top` value, the child is 
            positioned `bottom` units from the bottom of the parent's bounding box. Its height
            is set based on its `height` property.

            If the child includes both `top` and `bottom` values, the behavior is 
            platform-specific.
             
            Similar calculations are used for `left` and `right`. 

            You can also position a child by setting its `center` property to a <Point>.

            If no position is set explicitly, children are centered. For example, if a 
            child specifies a `top` of 20 and does not specify any other position properties,
            the child is positioned 20 units from the parent's top, and centered horizontally.

         *  `vertical`. Children are laid out vertically from top to bottom. The first child 
            is laid out `top` units from its parent's bounding box. Each subsequent child is 
            laid out below the previous child. The space between children is equal to the 
            upper child's `bottom` value plus the lower child's `top` value.

            Each child is positioned horizontally as for the absolute layout mode.

         *  `horizontal`. Like vertical layout, except children are laid out horizontally
            from left to right, using the `left` and `right` values to determine spacing.

            Each child is positioned vertically as in the absolute layout mode.
