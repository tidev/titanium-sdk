name: Titanium.UI.View
summary: An empty drawing surface or container created by the method <Titanium.UI.createView>.
description: |
    The `View` is the base type for all UI widgets in Titanium.

    
    #### Units and Coordinates
    
    Sizes and coordinates are specified using platform-specific units. 

    The default unit on Android is pixels, but users can specify other units, including 
    pixels (px), points (pt), device-independent pixels (dp or dip), millimeters (mm) or 
    inches (in). For example, '16pt' is interpreted as 16 points. Points on Android always 
    refers to the typographical unit of 1/72 of an inch.
    
    Android's density-independent pixels (DIPs) maintain a consistent visual size independent 
    of the display's density. One DIP corresponds to one pixel on a medium density display 
    (160 DPI).
    
    iOS accepts sizes in Apple "points," where one "point" corresponds to one pixel on 
    non-Retina displays, and two pixels on Retina displays. This unit is roughly equivalent
    to the Android density-independent pixel, and shouldn't be confused with the typographical
    unit. 
    
    Any unit specifier appended to a size or coordinate value on iOS is ignored: for example, 
    '16in' is interpreted as 16 Apple "points", as is '16px' or '16mm'. 

    Font sizes on iOS are treated differently than other sizes: font sizes are always 
    specified in typographical points.
    
    Mobile Web accepts all of the standard web units, including 
    pixels (px), ems (em), points (pt), picas (pc), millimeters (mm) or inches (in). The 
    default unit is pixels. Note that in Mobile Web, the interpretation of these units 
    is browser-dependent.

    Some [View](Titanium.UI.View) size fields, such as `height` and `width` accept the 
    special value `'auto'` to specify that the value should be calculated based on the 
    view's contents. Sizes and positions can also be specified as a percentage of the 
    parent, for example, '50%'.
    
    #### Size and Position
    
    Titanium views are positioned using the `left`, `right`, `top,` `bottom` and `center` 
    properties, and sized using the `width` and `height` properties. These are
    input properties, set by the user to specify layout, and not modified by the 
    system to indicate actual calculated positions and sizes. 
    
    How these properties are interpreted depends on the value of the view's `layout` 
    property. See the description of the [layout](Titanium.UI.View.layout) property 
    for details.
    
    The [size](Titanium.UI.View.size) property is a read-only dictionary with 
    two properties, `width` and `height`. It provides the *rendered* size of the 
    view, and thus is only available once both it and its ancestors have been 
    fully drawn.

methods:
  - name: add
    summary: Adds a child to this view's hierarchy.
    description: |
        There are certain top-level containers that are not intended to be added 
        as the children of other views. These top-level containers include 
        [Window](Titanium.UI.Window), [SplitWindow](Titanium.UI.iPad.SplitWindow),
        and [TabGroup](Titanium.UI.TabGroup).  Other types of views must be added 
        to a top-level container in order to be displayed on screen.

        The special containers [NavigationGroup](Titanium.UI.iPhone.NavigationGroup), 
        [SplitWindow](Titanium.UI.iPad.SplitWindow), [Tab](Titanium.UI.Tab), and 
        [TabGroup](Titanium.UI.TabGroup)
        manage windows. These managed windows may be referred to as *children* of the 
        container, but they are not added using the `add` method.
        
        Note that although a `NavigationGroup`
        manages windows, it is not itself top-level container.  It must be added to a 
        `Window` in order to be displayed. 
        
        `Tab` is another kind of special container: it is not itself a top-level container, 
        but can only be used within a `TabGroup`. You cannot `add` a `Tab` to an arbitrary
        container.
    parameters:
      - name: view
        summary: View to add to this view's hierarchy
        type: Titanium.UI.View
        
  - name: animate
    summary: Animates this view.
    description: |
        The [Animation](Titanium.UI.Animation) object or dictionary passed to this
        method defines the end state for the animation, the duration of the animation,
        and other properties.

        Note that if you use `animate` to move a view, the view's actual *position*
        is changed, but its layout properties, such as `top`, `left`, `center` and 
        so on are not changed--these reflect the original values set by the user, not
        the actual position of the view.
        
        In this release, the view's actual position is not available to the application. 
        This feature will be added to a future release.

        If you need one or more of the layout  properties to be updated after animation,
        you can update them in the callback after animation is complete. For example:

            var newTop = view1.top - 100;
            view1.animate({ top: newTop, duration: 500 }, function () {
                view.top = newTop; 
            });
    parameters:
      - name: obj
        summary: |
            Either a dictionary of animation properties or an 
            [Animation](Titanium.UI.Animation) object.
        type: [Titanium.UI.Animation,Dictionary<Titanium.UI.Animation>]
      - name: callback
        summary: Function to be invoked upon completion of the animation.

    description: |
        If both views are connected in the native view hierarchies, returns the 
        point, converted to `destinationView`'s coordinate system.

        Returns `null` if either view is not in the view hierarchy.
        Keep in mind that views may be removed from the view hierarchy if their window 
        is blurred or if the view is offscreen (such as in some situations with 
        <Titanium.UI.ScrollableView>).

        If this view is a <Titanium.UI.ScrollView>, the view's x and y offsets are 
        subtracted from the return value.

    returns:
        type: Point
    parameters:
      - name: point
        summary: |
            A point in this view's coordinate system.  
            If this argument is missing an `x` or `y` property, or the properties can not 
            be converted into numbers, an exception will be raised.
        type: Point
      - name: destinationView
        summary: |

events:
  - name: click
    summary: Fired when the device detects a click against the view.
    description: |
        There is a subtle difference between singletap and click events.

        A singletap event is generated when the user taps the screen briefly
        without moving their finger. This gesture will also generate a click event.

        However, a click event can also be generated when the user touches, 
        moves their finger, and then removes it from the screen.

        On Android, a click event can also be generated by a trackball click.

        type: Number
    
  - name: longclick
    summary: Fired when the device detects a long click.
    description: |
        A long click is generated by the user touching and holding on a touchscreen or,
        in the case of a trackball, holding down the button.  The event occurs before the
        finger/button is lifted up again.  If you have a longclick listener then the click
        event will not occur when you lift the finger/button after a long click.

  - name: longpress
    summary: Fired when the device detects a long press.
    description: |
        A long press is generated by the user touching and holding on a touchscreen.
        The event occurs before the finger is lifted again.  Both a `longpress`
        and a `longclick` can occur together.  The differences are that `longclick` 
        can be generated with the trackball whereas `longpress` is a touch-only event, 
        and `longpress` includes `x` and `y` coordinates.

    platforms: [android]
    type: String
    
  - name: backgroundGradient
    summary: A background gradient for the view.
    type: Gradient
    platforms: [iphone,ipad,mobileweb]
    description: |
        A gradient can be defined as either linear or radial. A linear gradient
        varies continuously along a line between the `startPoint` and `endPoint`.
        A radial gradient is interpolated between two circles, defined by `startPoint`
        and `startRadius` and `endPoint` and `endRadius` respectively.

        The start and end points and radius values can be defined in device units,
        in the view's coordinates, or as percentages of the view's size. Thus, if
        a view is 60 x 60, the center point of the view can be specified as:

            { x: 30, y: 30 }
        Or:
            { x: '50%', y: '50%' }

        When specifying multiple colors, you can specify an *offset* value for
        each color, defining how far into the gradient it takes effect. For example,
        the following color array specifies a gradient that goes from red to blue back to red:

            colors: [ { color: 'red', offset: 0.0}, { color: 'blue', offset: 0.25 }, { color: 'red', offset: 1.0 } ]
    examples:

        example: |
            The following code excerpt creates two views, one with a linear gradient and one with
            a radial gradient.

        End caps specify the portion of an image that should not be resized when an 
        image is stretched. This technique is used to implement buttons and other 
        resizable image-based interface elements. When a button with end caps is resized, 
        the resizing occurs only in the middle of the button, in the region between the end 
        caps. The end caps themselves keep their original size and appearance. This property 
        specifies the size of the left end cap. The middle (stretchable) portion is assumed to 
        be 1 pixel wide. The right end cap is therefore computed by adding the size of the left 
        end cap and the middle portion together and then subtracting that value from the width 
        of the image

  - name: layout
    type: String
    summary: |
        Specifies how the view positions its children. 
        One of: 'absolute', 'vertical', or 'horizontal'.
    description: |
        There are three layout options:

        *   `absolute`. Default layout. A child view's `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` 
            properties are interpreted as absolute values in the parent's coordinate space.

            If the child includes a `top` value and **not** a `bottom` value, the child is 
            positioned `top` units from the top of the parent's bounding box, and its height
            is set based on its `height` property.

            If the child includes a `bottom` value and **not** a `top` value, the child is 
            positioned `bottom` units from the bottom of the parent's bounding box. Its height
            is set based on its `height` property.

            If the child includes both `top` and `bottom` values, the behavior is 
            platform-specific.
             
            Similar calculations are used for `left` and `right`. 

            You can also position a child by setting its `center` property to a <Point>.

            If no position is set explicitly, children are centered. For example, if a 
            child specifies a `top` of 20 and does not specify any other position properties,
            the child is positioned 20 units from the parent's top, and centered horizontally.

         *  `vertical`. Children are laid out vertically from top to bottom. The first child 
            is laid out `top` units from its parent's bounding box. Each subsequent child is 
            laid out below the previous child. The space between children is equal to the 
            upper child's `bottom` value plus the lower child's `top` value.

            Each child is positioned horizontally as for the absolute layout mode.

         *  `horizontal`. Like vertical layout, except children are laid out horizontally
            from left to right, using the `left` and `right` values to determine spacing.

            Each child is positioned vertically as in the absolute layout mode.
