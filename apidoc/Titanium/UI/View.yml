    The `View` is the base type for all UI widgets in Titanium.
    
    #### Units and Coordinates
    
    Sizes and coordinates can be specified using a variety of units. If a value is
    specified as a number, it is interpreted as a value in the default unit for the
    current system and/or the current project.
    
    When a value is specified as string, the value can consist of:
    
    *  A number.
    *  A percentage, such as "10%", interpreted as a percentage of the parent's total size
       in that dimension.
    *  A number plus a unit specifier, such as "10px" or "1in". 
    
    The following units are supported:
    
    <table cellpadding="6px" border="1" rules="all">
    <tr>
    <th align="left">Unit</th> <th align="left">Specifier</th> <th align="left">Note</th>
    </tr>
    <tr> <td>pixels</td> <td>px</td> <td></td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>density-independent pixels</td> <td>dip</td> <td>Equivalent to Apple "points."</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>inches</td> <td>in</td> <td></td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>millimeters</td> <td>mm</td> <td>Android, iOS only</td>  </tr>
    <tr> <td>centimeters</td> <td>cm</td> <td>Android, iOS only</td>  </tr>
    <tr> <td>points</td> <td>pt</td> 
         <td>Typographical points of 1/72 of an inch. On Android, you can specify sizes and 
         coordinates in typographical points. On other platforms, this unit is only used
         to specify font sizes.  Not to be confused with Apple "points."</td> </tr>
    </table>
    
    The interpretation of the density-independent pixel (DIP) varies by platform:
    
    *   On Android, one DIP corresponds to one pixel on a 160DPI
        display.
    
    *   On iOS, one DIP corresponds to one pixel on a non-Retina display, which
        is 163DPI for iPhone/iPod touch and 132DPI for the iPad. A DIP
        corresponds to 2 pixels of width or height on a Retina display.
    
    *   On Mobile Web, both DIP and pixel are equal to one browser pixel, which may
        not correspond to a pixel on the display. From testing, most browsers seem to
        report a DPI value of 96DPI, regardless of the actual display density.
    
    The absolute measures, such as inches, are dependent on the device correctly reporting
    its density. On Mobile Web, in particular, these values are unlikely to be exact.
    
    If no units are specified, a system-default unit is assumed. The system default unit is:
    
    *    Pixels on Android.
    *    DIPs on iOS.
    *    DIPs on Mobile Web (as described above, DIPs and pixels are interchangable on
         Mobile Web).
    
    On Android and iOS, the default unit can be overriden on a per-application level by setting the
    `ti.ui.defaultunit` property in `tiapp.xml`. For example, to use DIPs as the 
    default on all platforms, set `defaultunit` to `dip`:
    
        <property name="ti.ui.defaultunit" type="string">dip</property>
    
    (This property is not supported on Mobile Web.)
    
    The value for `ti.ui.defaultunit` can be any of the unit specifiers defined above, or 
    `system` to specify that the platform's default unit should be used.
    
    Note that prior to Release 2.0, iOS ignored any specified unit, so code that specifies
    a unit may operate differently on iOS in Release 2.0. If you set the
    `ti.ui.defaultunit` property to anything other than `system` or `dip`, your
    application should detect and handle Retina displays manually.
    
    Font sizes on iOS are treated differently than other sizes: font sizes are always 
    specified in typographical points. 
    
    For more details see: 
    
    * [UI Composite Layout Spec](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/2.0/index.html#!/guide/UI_Composite_Layout_Behavior_Spec)
    
    #### Size and Position
    
    Titanium views are positioned using the `left`, `right`, `top,` `bottom` and `center` 
    properties, and sized using the `width` and `height` properties. These are
    input properties, set by the user to specify layout, and not modified by the 
    system to indicate actual calculated positions and sizes. 
    
    The [height](Titanium.UI.View.height) and [width](Titanium.UI.View.width) properties 
    accept several special values:
    
    *   <Titanium.UI.FILL> specifies that the view should fill the parent in this
        dimension.
    *   <Titanium.UI.SIZE> specifies that the view should adjust this size to fit its
        contents, such as a label's text or a view's children.
    *   'auto' specifies that the view should choose either `FILL` or `SIZE` behavior.
        In 2.0, the behavior of the 'auto' value is specified by the UI Composite Layout
        Spec. This value is not recommended for new development and will be deprecated in
        the future.
    
        On Mobile Web, 'auto' always selects `SIZE` behavior.
    
    Sizes and positions can also be specified as a percentage of the parent's size, for 
    example, '50%'.
    
    How these properties are interpreted depends on the value of the view's `layout` 
    property. See the description of the [layout](Titanium.UI.View.layout) property 
    for details.
    
    The [rect](Titanium.UI.View.rect) property is a read-only dictionary
    with the properties `x`, `y`, `width` and `height`. It provides the *rendered*
    size and position of the  view, and is only available once both it and its ancestors have been
    fully drawn.
    
    The [size](Titanium.UI.View.size) property is a read-only dictionary
    with the properties `x`, `y`, `width` and `height`. It provides the *rendered* size
     of the  view, and is only available once both it and its ancestors have been
    fully drawn. 
    
    To determine whether the `size` and `rect` values are available, add an event listener
    for the [postlayout](Titanium.UI.View.postlayout) event, which is fired at the end of
    a layout cycle.

events:
  - name: click
    summary: Fired when the device detects a click against the view.
    description: |
        There is a subtle difference between singletap and click events.

        A singletap event is generated when the user taps the screen briefly
        without moving their finger. This gesture will also generate a click event.

        However, a click event can also be generated when the user touches, 
        moves their finger, and then removes it from the screen.

        On Android, a click event can also be generated by a trackball click.

  - name: longclick
    summary: Fired when the device detects a long click.
    description: |
        A long click is generated by touching and holding on the touchscreen or holding down the 
        trackball button.  
        
        The event occurs before the finger/button is lifted.  
        
        A `longpress` and a `longclick` can occur together.  
        
        As the trackball can fire this event, it is not intended to return the `x` and `y` 
        coordinates of the touch, even when it is generated by the touchscreen.  
        
        A `longclick` blocks a `click`, meaning that a `click` event will not fire when a 
        `longclick` listener exists.
    platforms: [android]
    
  - name: longpress
    summary: Fired when the device detects a long press.
    description: |
        A long press is generated by touching and holding on the touchscreen. Unlike a `longclick`, 
        it does not respond to the trackball button.  
        
        The event occurs before the finger is lifted.   
        
        A `longpress` and a `longclick` can occur together.  
        
        In contrast to a `longclick`, this event returns the `x` and `y` coordinates of the touch.

    summary: Fired when the device detects a pinch gesture.
    description: |
        A pinch is a touch and expand or contract 
        with two fingers.  The event occurs continuously until a finger is lifted again.

      - name: scale
        summary: The scale factor relative to the points of the two touches in screen coordinates.
        type: Number
        
      - name: velocity
        summary: The velocity of the pinch in scale factor per second.
        type: Number
    
  - name: postlayout
    summary: Fired when a layout cycle is finished.
    description: |
        This event is fired when the view and its ancestors have been laid out.
        The [rect](Titanium.UI.View.rect) and [size](Titanium.UI.View.size) values 
        should be usable when this event is fired.
        
        This event is typically triggered by either changing layout
        properties or by changing the orientation of the device. Note that changing the 
        layout of child views or ancestors can also trigger a relayout of this view.
        On Mobile Web, this event can also be triggered by resizing the browser window.
        
        Note that altering any properties that affect layout from the `postlayout` callback 
        may result in an endless loop.

methods:
  - name: add
    summary: Adds a child to this view's hierarchy.
    description: |
        The child view is added as the last child in this view's hierarchy. 

        Although all views inherit from <Titanium.UI.View>, not all views are capable of
        containing other views. In particular:
        
        *    Some views are not designed to be containers at all.
        *    Some views are special-purpose containers that can only contain certain other
             views.
        *    Some views are top-level containers that cannot (or should not) be added to other views.

        #### Non-Container Views

        The following views are not intended to act as containers that can hold other
        views:

        *    [ActivityIndicator](Titanium.UI.ActivityIndicator)
        *    [Button](Titanium.UI.Button)
        *    [ImageView](Titanium.UI.ImageView)
        *    [Label](Titanium.UI.Label)
        *    [ProgressBar](Titanium.UI.ProgressBar)
        *    [SearchBar](Titanium.UI.SearchBar)
        *    [Slider](Titanium.UI.Slider)
        *    [Switch](Titanium.UI.Switch)
        *    [TableView](Titanium.UI.TableView)
        *    [TextArea](Titanium.UI.TextArea)
        *    [TextField](Titanium.UI.TextField)
        *    [WebView](Titanium.UI.WebView)

        Adding children to the these views _may_ be supported on some platforms,
        but is not guaranteed to work across platforms. Where it is supported, it may not
        work as expected.
        
        For maximum portability, these views should be treated as if they do not support children.  
        Instead of adding children to these views, applications can positon other views as
        siblings. For example, instead of adding a button as a child of a `WebView`, you can add
        the button to the web view's parent such that it appears on top of the web view. 

        #### Special-Purpose  Containers

        A few view objects act as special-purpose containers--that is, they only manage
        certain types of children, and many of them support a special means of adding
        these children, instead of the general `add` method. These containers include:
        
        *   [ButtonBar](Titanium.UI.ButtonBar) and [TabbedBar](Titanium.UI.iOS.TabbedBar) are designed 
            to hold their own internally-created buttons, assigned by adding strings to the "labels" array.
            Views added using the `add` method are displayed on top of these buttons.

        *   [Picker](Titanium.UI.Picker). Can only hold `PickerRows` and `PickerColumns`, which
            are added using the `add` method. Adding other types of views to a `Picker` is not
            supported.

        *   [TableView](Titanium.UI.TableView) is a specialized container for
            `TableViewSection` and `TableViewRow` objects. These objects must be
            added using the properties and methods that `TableView` provides 
            for adding and removing sectons and rows.

            On some platforms, it is possible to add arbitrary child views to a table view 
            using the `add` method. However, this is not guaranteed to work on all platforms, 
            and in general, should be avoided.

        *   [TableViewSection](Titanium.UI.TableViewSection) is a specialized container
            for `TableViewRow` objects, which _are_ added using the `add` method. The `add` method
            on `TableViewSection` can only be used to add `TableViewRow` objects.

        *   [Toolbar](Titanium.UI.iOS.Toolbar) is designed to hold buttons and certain
            other controls, added to its `items` array. Views added using the `add` method are
            displayed on top of the controls in the `items` array.

        *   The `Tab`, `TabGroup`, `NavigationGroup` and `SplitWindow` objects are 
            special containers that manage windows. These are discussed in the 
            "Top-Level Containers" section.


        #### Top-Level Containers
         
        There are certain top-level containers that are not intended to be added 
        as the children of other views. These top-level containers include 
        [Window](Titanium.UI.Window), [SplitWindow](Titanium.UI.iPad.SplitWindow),
        and [TabGroup](Titanium.UI.TabGroup).  Other types of views must be added 
        to a top-level container in order to be displayed on screen.

        The special containers [NavigationGroup](Titanium.UI.iPhone.NavigationGroup), 
        [SplitWindow](Titanium.UI.iPad.SplitWindow), [Tab](Titanium.UI.Tab), and 
        [TabGroup](Titanium.UI.TabGroup)
        manage windows. These managed windows may be referred to as *children* of the 
        container, but they are not added using the `add` method.
        
        Note that although a `NavigationGroup`
        manages windows, it is not itself top-level container.  It must be added to a 
        `Window` in order to be displayed. 
        
        `Tab` is another kind of special container: it is not itself a top-level container, 
        but can only be used within a `TabGroup`. You cannot `add` a `Tab` to an arbitrary
        container.

        The [Animation](Titanium.UI.Animation) object or dictionary passed to this method defines 
        the end state for the animation, the duration of the animation, and other properties.
        
        Note that if you use `animate` to move a view, the view's actual *position* is changed, but 
        its layout properties, such as `top`, `left`, `center` and so on are not changed--these 
        reflect the original values set by the user, not the actual position of the view.
        
        The [rect](Titanium.UI.View.rect) property can be used to determine the actual size and 
        position of the view. Note that on Mobile Web, the `rect` property is not updated after 
        animation. This is a known issue [TIMOB-8930](https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/TIMOB-8930).

    parameters:
      - name: animation
        summary: |

    summary: |
        Finishes a batch update of the View's layout properties and schedules a layout pass of the 
        view tree.
    description: |
        Since the layout pass scheduled is asynchronous, the [rect](Titanium.UI.View.rect)
        and [size](Titanium.UI.View.size) values may not be available immediately after 
        `finishLayout` is called. 
        
        To be notified when the layout pass completes, add a listener for the
        [postlayout](Titanium.UI.View.postlayout) event.
        
        On Mobile Web, this method has no effect, but is included for parity.

    parameters:
      - name: view
        summary: View to remove from this view's hierarchy.
        type: Titanium.UI.View
    
  - name: show
    summary: Makes this view visible.
    
  - name: startLayout
    summary: Starts a batch update of this view's layout properties.
    description: |
        To prevent a layout pass each time a property is modified, call `startLayout` before 
        changing any properties that may change this view's layout. This initiates a batch update 
        mode where layout changes are deferred.
        
        Call [finishLayout](Titanium.UI.View.finishLayout) to end batch update mode and trigger a 
        layout pass. For example:
        
            view.startLayout();
            view.top = 50;
            view.left = 50;
            view.finishLayout();
        
        Note that _any_ property changes made during the batch update _may_ be deferred until
        `finishLayout` is called. This may vary somewhat by platform. For example, changing the
        text of a label may trigger a layout pass. In iOS, updating the label text is
        deferred, while on Mobile Web, the label text is updated immediately but the control is 
        not resized until `finishLayout` is called.

    summary: |
        Performs a batch update of all supplied layout properties and schedules a layout pass after 
        they have been updated.
    description: |
        This is another way to perform a batch update.  The `updateLayout` method is called with a 
        dictionary of layout properties to perform the batch update. For example:
        
            view.updateLayout({top:50, left:50});
        
        This is equivalent to the following:
        
            view.startLayout();
            view.top = 50;
            view.left = 50;

        For normal views, the focused color is only used if `focusable` is `true`.
    type: String
    platforms: [android]
    
  - name: backgroundFocusedImage
    summary: Focused background image for the view, specified as a local file path or URL.
    description: For normal views, the focused background is only used if `focusable` is `true`.
    type: String
    platforms: [android]
    
  - name: backgroundGradient
    summary: A background gradient for the view.
    type: Gradient
    platforms: [iphone,ipad,mobileweb,android]
    description: |
        A gradient can be defined as either linear or radial. A linear gradient varies continuously 
        along a line between the `startPoint` and `endPoint`.
        
        A radial gradient is interpolated between two circles, defined by `startPoint` and 
        `startRadius` and `endPoint` and `endRadius` respectively.
        
        The start and end points and radius values can be defined in device units, in the view's 
        coordinates, or as percentages of the view's size. Thus, if a view is 60 x 60, the center 
        point of the view can be specified as:
        
            { x: 30, y: 30 }
        Or:
            { x: '50%', y: '50%' }
        
        When specifying multiple colors, you can specify an *offset* value for each color, defining 
        how far into the gradient it takes effect. For example, the following color array specifies 
        a gradient that goes from red to blue back to red: 
        
            colors: [ { color: 'red', offset: 0.0}, { color: 'blue', offset: 0.25 }, { color: 'red', offset: 1.0 } ]
        
        Mobile Web has two limitations: backfillStart and backfillEnd are ignored and the system 
        behaves as if they are true, and endPoint is not supported for radial gradients. 

        Android currently only supports linear gradients. It also ignores backfillStart and backfillEnd
        treating them as if they are true.
    examples:
      - title: Linear and Radial Gradients
        example: |
            The following code excerpt creates two views, one with a linear gradient and one with
            a radial gradient.
            
                var win1 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
                    title:'Tab 1',
                    backgroundColor:'#fff',
                    layout: 'vertical'
                });
                
                var radialGradient = Ti.UI.createView({
                    top: 10,
                    width: 100,
                    height: 100,
                    backgroundGradient: {
                        type: 'radial',
                        startPoint: { x: 50, y: 50 },
                        endPoint: { x: 50, y: 50 },
                        colors: [ 'red', 'blue'],
                        startRadius: '90%',
                        endRadius: 0,
                        backfillStart: true
                    }
                });
                var linearGradient = Ti.UI.createView({
                    top: 10,
                    width: 100,
                    height: 100,
                    backgroundGradient: {
                        type: 'linear',
                        startPoint: { x: '0%', y: '50%' },
                        endPoint: { x: '100%', y: '50%' },
                        colors: [ { color: 'red', offset: 0.0}, { color: 'blue', offset: 0.25 }, { color: 'red', offset: 1.0 } ],
                    }
                });
                win1.add(radialGradient);

    summary: Background image for the view, specified as a local file path or URL.
    type: String
    
  - name: backgroundRepeat
    summary: Determines whether to tile a background across a view.
    description: |
        Setting this to `true` makes the set `backgroundImage` repeat across the view as a series 
        of tiles. The tiling begins in the upper-left corner, where the upper-left corner of the 
        background image is rendered. The image is then tiled to fill the available space of the 
        view.
        
        Note that setting this to `true` may incur performance penalties for large views or 
        background images, as the tiling must be redone whenever a view is resized.
        
        On iOS, the following views do not currently support tiled backgrounds:
        
        * <Titanium.UI.Button>
        * <Titanium.UI.TextField>
        * <Titanium.UI.Label>

  - name: backgroundLeftCap
    summary: Size of the left end cap.
    description: |
        End caps specify the portion of an image that should not be resized when an image is 
        stretched. This technique is used to implement buttons and other resizable image-based 
        interface elements. When a button with end caps is resized, the resizing occurs only in 
        the middle of the button, in the region between the end caps. The end caps themselves keep 
        their original size and appearance. This property specifies the size of the left end cap. 
        The middle (stretchable) portion is assumed to be 1 pixel wide. The right end cap is 
        therefore computed by adding the size of the left end cap and the middle portion together 
        and then subtracting that value from the width of the image

        *    <Titanium.UI.SIZE>. The view should size itself to fit its contents.
        *    <Titanium.UI.FILL>. The view should size itself to fill its parent. 
        *    'auto'.  Represents the default sizing behavior for a given type of
             view. The use of 'auto' is deprecated, and should be replaced with the `SIZE` or
             `FILL` constants if it is necessary to set the view's behavior explicitly.
        
             On Mobile Web, 'auto' always selects `SIZE` behavior.
        
        This is an input property for specifying the view's height dimension. To determine the 
        view's size once rendered, use the [rect](Titanium.UI.View.rect) or

  - name: layout
    type: String
    summary: |
        Specifies how the view positions its children. 
        One of: 'composite', 'vertical', or 'horizontal'.
    description: |
        There are three layout options:
        
        *   `composite` (or `absolute`). Default layout. A child view is positioned based on its 
            positioning properties or "pins"  (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` and `center`). 
            If no positioning  properties are specified, the child is centered. 
            
            The child is always sized based on its `width` and `height` properties, if these are
            specified.  If the child's height or width is *not* specified explicitly, it may be 
            calculated implicitly from the positioning properties. For example, if both `left` and
            `center.x` are specified, they can be used to calculate the width of the child control. 
            
            Because the size and position properties can conflict, there is a specific precedence
            order for the layout properties.  For vertical positioning, the precedence
            order is: `height`, `top`, `center.y`, `bottom`.
            
            The following table summarizes the various combinations of properties that can
            be used for vertical positioning, in order from highest precedence to lowest.
            (For example, if `height`, `center.y` and `bottom` are all specified, the
            `height` and `center.y` values take precedence.)

            Horizontal positioning works like vertical positioning, except that the
            precedence is `width`, `left`, `center.x`, `right`. 
            
            For complete details on composite layout rules, see
            [Transitioning to the New UI Layout System](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/2.0/index.html#!/guide/Transitioning_to_the_New_UI_Layout_System)
            in the Titanium Mobile Guides. 
            
         *  `vertical`. Children are laid out vertically from top to bottom. The first child 
            is laid out `top` units from its parent's bounding box. Each subsequent child is 
            laid out below the previous child. The space between children is equal to the 
            upper child's `bottom` value plus the lower child's `top` value. 
            
            Each child is positioned horizontally as in the composite layout mode. 
            
         *  `horizontal`. Horizontal layouts have different behavior depending on whether wrapping 
            is enabled. Wrapping is enabled by default (the `horizontalWrap` property is `true`).
            
            With wrapping behavior, the children are laid out horizontally from left to right,
            _in rows_. If a child requires more horizontal space than exists in the current row,
            it is wrapped to a new row. The height of each row is equal to the maximum height of
            the children in that row.
            
            Wrapping behavior is available on iOS, Android and Mobile Web (Release 2.1.0 and later).
            When the `horizontalWrap` property is set to true, the first row is placed at the top of the 
            parent view, and successive rows are placed below the first row. Each child is 
            positioned vertically _within its row_ somewhat like composite layout mode. 
            In particular: 
            
            *   If neither `top` or `bottom` is specified, the child is centered in the
                row.
            *   If either `top` or `bottom` is specified, the child is aligned to either
                the top or bottom of the row, with the specified amount of padding.
            *   If *both* `top` and `bottom` is specified for a given child, the properties
                are both treated as padding.
            
            If the `horizontalWrap` property is false, the behavior is more equivalent to a vertical layout. 
            Children are laid or horizontally from left to right in a single row. The `left` and 
            `right` properties are used as padding between the children, and the `top` and `bottom` 
            properties are used to position the children vertically.
            
            On Mobile Web _prior to_ Release 2.1.0, the horizontal layout does not wrap by default, 
            and does not support the `horizontalWrap` property. On Android and iOS _prior to_ Release 
            2.1.0, the horizontal layout always wraps and the `horizontalWrap` property is not supported.

  - name: right
    summary: View's right position, in platform-specific units.
    description: |
        This position is relative to the view's parent. Exact interpretation depends on the 
        parent view's [layout](Titanium.UI.View.layout) property. Can be either a float value or 
        a dimension string (for example, '50%' or '10px').

  - name: rect
    summary: |
        The bounding box of the view relative to its parent, in system units.
    description: |
        The view's bounding box is defined by its size and position. 
        
        The view's size is `rect.width` x `rect.height`. The view's top-left position relative to 
        its parent is (`rect.x` , `rect.y`). 
        
        The correct values will only be available when layout is complete.
        To determine when layout is complete, add a listener for the 
        [postlayout](Titanium.UI.View.postlayout) event.

        properties are valid. The position properties--`x` and `y`--are always 0.
        
        To find the position _and_ size of the view, use the [rect](Titanium.UI.View.rect) 
        property instead.

  - name: width
    summary: View's width, in platform-specific units.
    description: |
        Can be either a float value or a dimension string (for example, '50%' or '40dp').
        Can also be one of the following special values: 
        
        *    <Titanium.UI.SIZE>. The view should size itself to fit its contents.
        *    <Titanium.UI.FILL>. The view should size itself to fill its parent. 
        *    'auto'.  Represents the default sizing behavior for a given type of
             view. The use of 'auto' is deprecated, and should be replaced with the `SIZE` or
             `FILL` constants if it is necessary to set the view's behavior explicitly.
        
        On Mobile Web, 'auto' always selects `SIZE` behavior.
        
        This is an input property for specifying the view's width dimension. To determine 
        the view's size once rendered, use the [rect](Titanium.UI.View.rect) or
        [size](Titanium.UI.View.size) properties.
