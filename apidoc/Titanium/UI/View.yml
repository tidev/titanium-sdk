    The `View` is the base type for all UI widgets in Titanium.

    You use the <Titanium.UI.createView> method or **`<View>`** Alloy element to create a View.

    #### Units and Coordinates

    Sizes and coordinates can be specified using a variety of units. If a value is
    specified as a number, it is interpreted as a value in the default unit for the
    current system and/or the current project.

    When a value is specified as string, the value can consist of:

    *  A number.
    *  A percentage, such as "10%", interpreted as a percentage of the parent's total size
       in that dimension.
    *  A number plus a unit specifier, such as "10px" or "1in".

    The following units are supported:

    <table class="doc-table" width="60%">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Unit</th>
          <th>Specifier</th>
          <th>Note</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>pixels</td>
          <td>px</td>
          <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>density-independent pixels</td>
          <td>dip</td>
          <td>Equivalent to Apple "points."</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>inches</td>
          <td>in</td>
          <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>millimeters</td>
          <td>mm</td>
          <td>Android, iOS only</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>centimeters</td>
          <td>cm</td>
          <td>Android, iOS only</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>points</td>
          <td>pt</td>
          <td>Typographical points of 1/72 of an inch. On Android, you can specify sizes and coordinates in typographical points. On other platforms, this unit is only used to specify font sizes. Not to be confused with Apple "points."</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    The interpretation of the density-independent pixel (DIP) varies by platform:

    *   On Android, one DIP corresponds to one pixel on a 160DPI
        display.

    *   On iOS, one DIP corresponds to one pixel on a non-Retina display, which
        is 163DPI for iPhone/iPod touch and 132DPI for the iPad. A DIP
        corresponds to 2 pixels of width or height on a Retina display.

    The absolute measures, such as inches, are dependent on the device correctly reporting
    its density.

    If no units are specified, a system-default unit is assumed. The system default unit is:

    *    Pixels on Android.
    *    DIPs on iOS.

    On Android and iOS, the default unit can be overriden on a per-application level by setting the
    `ti.ui.defaultunit` property in `tiapp.xml`. For example, to use DIPs as the
    default on all platforms, set `defaultunit` to `dip`:

    ``` xml
    <property name="ti.ui.defaultunit" type="string">dip</property>
    ```

    The value for `ti.ui.defaultunit` can be any of the unit specifiers defined above, or
    `system` to specify that the platform's default unit should be used.

    On IOS if you set the `ti.ui.defaultunit` property to anything other than `system` or `dip`, your
    application should detect and handle Retina displays manually.

    Font sizes on iOS are treated differently than other sizes: font sizes are always
    specified in typographical points.

    For more details see:

    * [UI Composite Layout Spec](https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/UI_Composite_Layout_Behavior_Spec)

    #### Size and Position

    Titanium views are positioned using the `left`, `right`, `top,` `bottom` and `center`
    properties, and sized using the `width` and `height` properties. These are
    input properties, set by the user to specify layout, and not modified by the
    system to indicate actual calculated positions and sizes.

    The [height](Titanium.UI.View.height) and [width](Titanium.UI.View.width) properties
    accept several special values:

    *   <Titanium.UI.FILL> specifies that the view should fill the parent in this
        dimension.
    *   <Titanium.UI.SIZE> specifies that the view should adjust this size to fit its
        contents, such as a label's text or a view's children.
    *   'auto' specifies that the view should choose either `FILL` or `SIZE` behavior.
        The use of `auto` is deprecated, and should be replaced with the SIZE or FILL constants if it is necessary to set the view's behavior explicitly.

    Sizes and positions can also be specified as a percentage of the parent's size, for
    example, `50%`.

    How these properties are interpreted depends on the value of the view's `layout`
    property. See the description of the [layout](Titanium.UI.View.layout) property
    for details.

    The [rect](Titanium.UI.View.rect) property is a read-only dictionary
    with the properties `x`, `y`, `width` and `height`. It provides the *rendered*
    size and position of the  view, and is only available once both it and its ancestors have been
    fully drawn.

    The [size](Titanium.UI.View.size) property is a read-only dictionary
    with the properties `x`, `y`, `width` and `height`. It provides the *rendered* size
     of the  view, and is only available once both it and its ancestors have been
    fully drawn.

    To determine whether the `size` and `rect` values are available, add an event listener
    for the [postlayout](Titanium.UI.View.postlayout) event, which is fired at the end of
    a layout cycle.

    #### Accessibility

    Four accessibility-related view properties are available in Titanium Mobile for iOS
    and Android:

    * <Titanium.UI.View.accessibilityLabel>
    * <Titanium.UI.View.accessibilityValue>
    * <Titanium.UI.View.accessibilityHint>
    * <Titanium.UI.View.accessibilityHidden>

    The first three, `accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityValue` and `accessibilityHint`, are for setting text
    that will be relayed to the user by the assistive service (such as TalkBack on Android or VoiceOver
    on iOS). On iOS, Titanium will then take these values and set the native properties
    of the same name which are defined in the [UIAccessibilityProtocol](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/accessibility/uiaccessibility).
    On Android, Titanium takes the three values and concatenates them in the order `accessibilityLabel`,
    `accessibilityValue`, and `accessibilityHint`, and then uses the result to set the native view's
    [`contentDescription`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#setContentDescription%28java.lang.CharSequence%29)
    property.

    You are not required to set all three properties: feel free to set just one or two as needed and
    experiment with the results by turning on VoiceOver (iOS) or TalkBack (Android) on your test device.

    The fourth property, `accessibilityHidden`, when set to `true`, indicates that the view can be ignored
    by the assistive service. In iOS this sets the similarly-named
    [accessibilityElementsHidden](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1615080-accessibilityelementshidden)
    native property.

    In Android `accessibilityHidden` calls the native [View.setImportantForAccessibility(boolean)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#setImportantForAccessibility%28int%29) method, passing `false` when
    this property is set to `true` (i.e., "hidden" means it's not important). However, the
    native `setImportantForAccessibility` method is available only on devices running
    Android 4.1 (API level 16/Jelly Bean) or later. On earlier versions of Android, this
    property is ignored.

    No error will occur on older devices if you set `accessibilityHidden`; the value will simply be ignored.

    #### iOS: backgroundLeftCap and backgroundTopCap properties

    The [backgroundLeftCap](Titanium.UI.View.backgroundLeftCap) and [backgroundTopCap](Titanium.UI.View.backgroundTopCap) properties are
    used to specify the portions of the [backgroundImage](Titanium.UI.View.backgroundImage) that must not be resized when the image is streched or shrunk.

    Given an image of width `w` and height `h`, the stretchable portion on the image is defined as a rectangle with the `top-left` point set to
    `(backgroundLeftCap , backgroundTopCap)` and the `bottom-right` point set to `(w - backgroundLeftCap , h - backgroundTopCap)`. The portions not covered by
    the stretchable portion keep their original size and appearance.

    For best results on ImageView set up the `backgroundLeftCap` and `backgroundTopCap` properties such that the stretchable portion is always a 1x1 box.

    #### iOS Clipping Behavior

    Four view related properties are available in Titanium Mobile for iOS.

    * <Titanium.UI.View.viewShadowRadius>
    * <Titanium.UI.View.viewShadowColor>
    * <Titanium.UI.View.viewShadowOffset>
    * <Titanium.UI.View.clipMode>

    The first three, `viewShadowColor`, `viewShadowRadius` and `viewShadowOffset` control the shadow associated with the view.
    The shadow of the view is drawn using a rounded rectangle with the arc radius set to the `borderRadius` property.

    The `clipMode` property lets the user control the clipping behavior of the View.
    Setting this to <Titanium.UI.iOS.CLIP_MODE_ENABLED> enforces all child views to be clipped to this views bounds.
    Setting this to <Titanium.UI.iOS.CLIP_MODE_DISABLED> allows child views to be drawn outside the bounds of this view.
    When set to <Titanium.UI.iOS.CLIP_MODE_DEFAULT> or when this property is not set, clipping behavior is defined by the following rules applied in order.

    * If the `viewShadowColor` is defined to be a color with alpha > 0, clipping is disabled.
    * If the `borderWidth` or `borderRadius` of the view is set to a value > 0, clipping is enabled.
    * If the view has one or more `children` clipping is enabled.
    * If none of the conditions are met, clipping is disabled.

    In earlier versions of Titanium Mobile, views had clipping enabled by default.

    #### iOS Animation on shadow associated with view

    If `borderRadius` property has multiple values, animation on shadow associated with the view will not work.

  - name: click
    summary: Fired when the device detects a click against the view.
    description: |
        There is a subtle difference between singletap and click events.

        A singletap event is generated when the user taps the screen briefly
        without moving their finger. This gesture will also generate a click event.

        However, a click event can also be generated when the user touches,
        moves their finger, and then removes it from the screen.

        On Android, a click event can also be generated by a trackball click.

  - name: keypressed
    summary: Fired when a hardware key is pressed in the view.
    description: |
        A keypressed event is generated by pressing a hardware key. On Android, this event can only be
        fired when the property [focusable](Titanium.UI.View.focusable) is set to true. On iOS the
        event is generated only when using [Ti.UI.TextArea](Titanium.UI.TextArea), [Ti.UI.TextField](Titanium.UI.TextField)
        and [Ti.UI.SearchBar](Titanium.UI.SearchBar).

        summary: The code for the physical key that was pressed. For more details, see [KeyEvent](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent.html). This API is experimental and subject to change.

  - name: longclick
    summary: Fired when the device detects a long click.
    description: |
        A long click is generated by touching and holding on the touchscreen or holding down the
        trackball button.

        The event occurs before the finger/button is lifted.

        A `longpress` and a `longclick` can occur together.

        As the trackball can fire this event, it is not intended to return the `x` and `y`
        coordinates of the touch, even when it is generated by the touchscreen.

        A `longclick` blocks a `click`, meaning that a `click` event will not fire when a
        `longclick` listener exists.
    platforms: [android]

  - name: longpress
    summary: Fired when the device detects a long press.
    description: |
        A long press is generated by touching and holding on the touchscreen. Unlike a `longclick`,
        it does not respond to the trackball button.

        The event occurs before the finger is lifted.

        A `longpress` and a `longclick` can occur together.

        In contrast to a `longclick`, this event returns the `x` and `y` coordinates of the touch.

methods:
  - name: add
    summary: Adds a child to this view's hierarchy.
    description: |
        The child view is added as the last child in this view's hierarchy.

        Although all views inherit from <Titanium.UI.View>, not all views are capable of
        containing other views. In particular:

        *    Some views are not designed to be containers at all.
        *    Some views are special-purpose containers that can only contain certain other
             views.
        *    Some views are top-level containers that cannot (or should not) be added to other views.

        #### Non-Container Views

        The following views are not intended to act as containers that can hold other
        views:

        *    [ActivityIndicator](Titanium.UI.ActivityIndicator)
        *    [Button](Titanium.UI.Button)
        *    [ImageView](Titanium.UI.ImageView)
        *    [Label](Titanium.UI.Label)
        *    [ProgressBar](Titanium.UI.ProgressBar)
        *    [SearchBar](Titanium.UI.SearchBar)
        *    [Slider](Titanium.UI.Slider)
        *    [Switch](Titanium.UI.Switch)
        *    [TableView](Titanium.UI.TableView)
        *    [TextArea](Titanium.UI.TextArea)
        *    [TextField](Titanium.UI.TextField)
        *    [WebView](Titanium.UI.WebView)

        Adding children to the these views _may_ be supported on some platforms,
        but is not guaranteed to work across platforms. Where it is supported, it may not
        work as expected.

        For maximum portability, these views should be treated as if they do not support children.
        Instead of adding children to these views, applications can positon other views as
        siblings. For example, instead of adding a button as a child of a `WebView`, you can add
        the button to the web view's parent such that it appears on top of the web view.

        #### Special-Purpose  Containers

        A few view objects act as special-purpose containers--that is, they only manage
        certain types of children, and many of them support a special means of adding
        these children, instead of the general `add` method. These containers include:

        *   [ButtonBar](Titanium.UI.ButtonBar) and [TabbedBar](Titanium.UI.iOS.TabbedBar) are designed
            to hold their own internally-created buttons, assigned by adding strings to the "labels" array.
            Views added using the `add` method are displayed on top of these buttons.

        *   [Picker](Titanium.UI.Picker). Can only hold `PickerRows` and `PickerColumns`, which
            are added using the `add` method. Adding other types of views to a `Picker` is not
            supported.

        *   [TableView](Titanium.UI.TableView) is a specialized container for
            `TableViewSection` and `TableViewRow` objects. These objects must be
            added using the properties and methods that `TableView` provides
            for adding and removing sectons and rows.

            On some platforms, it is possible to add arbitrary child views to a table view
            using the `add` method. However, this is not guaranteed to work on all platforms,
            and in general, should be avoided.

        *   [TableViewSection](Titanium.UI.TableViewSection) is a specialized container
            for `TableViewRow` objects, which _are_ added using the `add` method. The `add` method
            on `TableViewSection` can only be used to add `TableViewRow` objects.

        *   [Toolbar](Titanium.UI.iOS.Toolbar) is designed to hold buttons and certain
            other controls, added to its `items` array. Views added using the `add` method are
            displayed on top of the controls in the `items` array.

        *   The `Tab`, `TabGroup`, `NavigationWindow` and `SplitWindow` objects are
            special containers that manage windows. These are discussed in the
            "Top-Level Containers" section.


        #### Top-Level Containers

        There are certain top-level containers that are not intended to be added
        as the children of other views. These top-level containers include
        <Titanium.UI.Window>, <Titanium.UI.iPad.SplitWindow>, <Titanium.UI.NavigationWindow>,
        and <Titanium.UI.TabGroup>.  Other types of views must be added
        to a top-level container in order to be displayed on screen.

        The special containers <Titanium.UI.NavigationWindow>,
        <Titanium.UI.iPad.SplitWindow>, <Titanium.UI.Tab>, and
        <Titanium.UI.TabGroup> manage windows.
        These managed windows may be referred to as *children* of the
        container, but they are not added using the `add` method.

        `Tab` is another kind of special container: it is not itself a top-level container,
        but can only be used within a `TabGroup`. You cannot `add` a `Tab` to an arbitrary
        container.
    parameters:

  - name: animate
    summary: Animates this view.
    description: |
        The [Animation](Titanium.UI.Animation) object or dictionary passed to this method defines
        the end state for the animation, the duration of the animation, and other properties.

        Note that on SDKs older than 9.1.0 - if you use `animate` to move a view, the view's actual *position* is changed, but
        its layout properties, such as `top`, `left`, `center` and so on are not changed--these
        reflect the original values set by the user, not the actual position of the view.

        As of SDK 9.1.0, the final values of the animation will be set on the view just before the `complete` event and/or the callback is fired.

        The [rect](Titanium.UI.View.rect) property can be used to determine the actual size and
        position of the view.
    parameters:
      - name: animation
        summary: |

  - name: startLayout
    summary: Starts a batch update of this view's layout properties.
    description: |
        To prevent a layout pass each time a property is modified, call `startLayout` before
        changing any properties that may change this view's layout. This initiates a batch update
        mode where layout changes are deferred.

        Call [finishLayout](Titanium.UI.View.finishLayout) to end batch update mode and trigger a
        layout pass. For example:

        ``` js
        view.startLayout();
        view.top = 50;
        view.left = 50;
        view.finishLayout();
        ```

        Note that _any_ property changes made during the batch update _may_ be deferred until
        `finishLayout` is called. This may vary somewhat by platform. For example, changing the
        text of a label may trigger a layout pass. In iOS, updating the label text is
        deferred.

        On iOS this is a direct analog of the `accessibilityElementsHidden` property defined in the
        [UIAccessibility
        Protocol](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/accessibility/uiaccessibility).

        On Android, setting `accessibilityHidden` calls the native
        [View.setImportantForAccessibility](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#setImportantForAccessibility%28int%29)
        method. The native method is only available in Android 4.1 (API level 16/Jelly Bean) and
        later; if this property is specified on earlier versions of Android, it is ignored.

    type: [ String, Titanium.UI.Color ]

  - name: backgroundDisabledColor
    summary: Disabled background color of the view, as a color name or hex triplet.
    description: |
        For information about color values, see the "Colors" section of <Titanium.UI>.
        Defaults to the normal background color of this view.
    type: String
    platforms: [android]

  - name: backgroundDisabledImage
    summary: Disabled background image for the view, specified as a local file path or URL.

  - name: backgroundFocusedColor
    summary: Focused background color of the view, as a color name or hex triplet.
    description: |
        For information about color values, see the "Colors" section of <Titanium.UI>.

        For normal views, the focused color is only used if `focusable` is `true`.
        Defaults to the normal background color of this view.
    type: String
    platforms: [android]

  - name: backgroundFocusedImage
    summary: Focused background image for the view, specified as a local file path or URL.
    description: |
      For normal views, the focused background is only used if `focusable` is `true`.

      is set, the normal image is used when this view is focused.
    type: String
    platforms: [android]

  - name: backgroundGradient
    summary: A background gradient for the view.
    type: Gradient
    platforms: [iphone,ipad,android]
    description: |
        A gradient can be defined as either linear or radial. A linear gradient varies continuously
        along a line between the `startPoint` and `endPoint`.

        A radial gradient is interpolated between two circles, defined by `startPoint` and
        `startRadius` and `endPoint` and `endRadius` respectively.

        The start points, end points and radius values can be defined in device units, in the view's
        coordinates, or as percentages of the view's size. Thus, if a view is 60 x 60, the center
        point of the view can be specified as:

        ``` js
        { x: 30, y: 30 }
        ```

        Or:
        ``` js
        { x: '50%', y: '50%' }
        ```

        When specifying multiple colors, you can specify an *offset* value for each color, defining
        how far into the gradient it takes effect. For example, the following color array specifies
        a gradient that goes from red to blue back to red:

        ``` js
        colors: [ { color: 'red', offset: 0.0}, { color: 'blue', offset: 0.25 }, { color: 'red', offset: 1.0 } ]
        ```

        Android's linear gradients ignores `backfillStart` and `backfillEnd`, treating them as if
        they are true. Android's radial gradients ignore the `endPoint` property.
        Defaults to no gradient.
    examples:
      - title: Linear and Radial Gradients
        example: |
            The following code excerpt creates two views, one with a linear gradient and one with
            a radial gradient.

            ``` js
            var win1 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
                title:'Tab 1',
                backgroundColor:'#fff',
                layout: 'vertical'
            });

            var radialGradient = Ti.UI.createView({
                top: 10,
                width: 100,
                height: 100,
                backgroundGradient: {
                    type: 'radial',

                    colors: [ 'red', 'blue'],
                    startRadius: 50,
                    endRadius: 0,
                    backfillStart: true
                }
            });
            var linearGradient = Ti.UI.createView({
                top: 10,
                width: 100,

            ```

  - name: backgroundImage
    summary: Background image for the view, specified as a local file path or URL.
    description: |
        Default behavior when `backgroundImage` is unspecified depends on the type of view and the platform.
        For generic views, no image is used. For most controls (buttons, textfields, and so on), platform-specific default images are used.
    type: String

  - name: backgroundRepeat
    summary: Determines whether to tile a background across a view.
    description: |
        Setting this to `true` makes the set `backgroundImage` repeat across the view as a series
        of tiles. The tiling begins in the upper-left corner, where the upper-left corner of the
        background image is rendered. The image is then tiled to fill the available space of the
        view.

        Note that setting this to `true` may incur performance penalties for large views or
        background images, as the tiling must be redone whenever a view is resized.

        On iOS, the following views do not currently support tiled backgrounds:

        * <Titanium.UI.Button>
        * <Titanium.UI.TextField>
        * <Titanium.UI.Label>
    type: Boolean

    platforms: [android]

  - name: backgroundSelectedImage
    summary: Selected background image url for the view, specified as a local file path or URL.
    description: |
      For normal views, the selected background is only used if `focusable` is `true`.

      If `backgroundSelectedImage` is undefined, and the normal background image `backgroundImage` is set
      the normal image is used when this view is selected.
    type: String

    type: Number
    default: 0

  - name: bottom
    summary: View's bottom position, in platform-specific units.
    description: |
        This position is relative to the view's parent. Exact interpretation depends on the parent
        view's [layout](Titanium.UI.View.layout) property. Can be either a float value or a
        dimension string (for example, '50%' or '10px').

        This is an input property for specifying where the view should be positioned, and does not
        represent the view's calculated position.

        Defaults to `undefined`.

    permission: read-only

  - name: clipMode
    summary: View's clipping behavior.
    description: |
        Setting this to <Titanium.UI.iOS.CLIP_MODE_ENABLED> enforces all child views to be clipped to this views bounds.
        Setting this to <Titanium.UI.iOS.CLIP_MODE_DISABLED> allows child views to be drawn outside the bounds of this view.
        When set to <Titanium.UI.iOS.CLIP_MODE_DEFAULT> or when this property is not set, clipping behavior is inferred.
        See section on iOS Clipping Behavior in <Titanium.UI.View>.

        Defaults to `undefined`. Behaves as if set to <Titanium.UI.iOS.CLIP_MODE_DEFAULT>.

  - name: elevation
    summary: Base elevation of the view relative to its parent in pixels.
    description: |
        The elevation of a view determines the appearance of its shadow.
        Higher elevations produce larger and softer shadows.

        **Note:** The `elevation` property only works on `Titanium.UI.View` objects.
        Many Android components have a default elevation that cannot be modified.

  - name: height
    summary: View height, in platform-specific units.
    description: |
        Defaults to: If undefined, defaults to either <Titanium.UI.FILL> or <Titanium.UI.SIZE>
        depending on the view. See "View Types and Default Layout Behavior" in
        [Transitioning to the New UI Layout System](https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/Transitioning_to_the_New_UI_Layout_System).

        Can be either a float value or a dimension string (for example, '50%' or '40dp').
        Can also be one of the following special values:

        *    <Titanium.UI.SIZE>. The view should size itself to fit its contents.
        *    <Titanium.UI.FILL>. The view should size itself to fill its parent.
        *    'auto'.  Represents the default sizing behavior for a given type of
             view. The use of 'auto' is deprecated, and should be replaced with the `SIZE` or
             `FILL` constants if it is necessary to set the view's behavior explicitly.

        This is an input property for specifying the view's height dimension. To determine the
        view's size once rendered, use the [rect](Titanium.UI.View.rect) or
        [size](Titanium.UI.View.size) properties.
    constants: [Titanium.UI.FILL, Titanium.UI.SIZE]
    type: [Number,String]

  - name: hiddenBehavior
    summary: Sets the behavior when hiding an object to release or keep the free space
    description: |
        If setting `hiddenBehavior` to <Titanium.UI.HIDDEN_BEHAVIOR_GONE> it will automatically release the space the view occupied.
        For example: in a vertical layout the views below the object will move up when you hide
        an object with `hiddenBehavior:Titanium.UI.HIDDEN_BEHAVIOR_GONE`.

        * <Titanium.UI.HIDDEN_BEHAVIOR_INVISIBLE>. Keeps the space and just hides the object (default).
        * <Titanium.UI.HIDDEN_BEHAVIOR_GONE>. Releases the space and hides the object.

        Defaults to Titanium.UI.HIDDEN_BEHAVIOR_INVISIBLE.

    type: String
    accessors: false
    optional: true

  - name: left
    summary: View's left position, in platform-specific units.
    description: |
        This position is relative to the view's parent. Exact interpretation depends on the
        parent view's [layout](Titanium.UI.View.layout) property. Can be either a float value or
        a dimension string (for example, '50%' or '10px').

        This is an input property for specifying where the view should be positioned, and does not
        represent the view's calculated position.

        Defaults to `undefined`.
    type: [Number,String]

  - name: layout
    type: String
    summary: |
        Specifies how the view positions its children.
        One of: 'composite', 'vertical', or 'horizontal'.
    description: |
        There are three layout options:

        *   `composite` (or `absolute`). Default layout. A child view is positioned based on its
            positioning properties or "pins"  (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` and `center`).
            If no positioning  properties are specified, the child is centered.

            The child is always sized based on its `width` and `height` properties, if these are
            specified.  If the child's height or width is *not* specified explicitly, it may be
            calculated implicitly from the positioning properties. For example, if both `left` and
            `center.x` are specified, they can be used to calculate the width of the child control.

            Because the size and position properties can conflict, there is a specific precedence
            order for the layout properties.  For vertical positioning, the precedence
            order is: `height`, `top`, `center.y`, `bottom`.

            The following table summarizes the various combinations of properties that can
            be used for vertical positioning, in order from highest precedence to lowest.
            (For example, if `height`, `center.y` and `bottom` are all specified, the
            `height` and `center.y` values take precedence.)

            Horizontal positioning works like vertical positioning, except that the
            precedence is `width`, `left`, `center.x`, `right`.

            For complete details on composite layout rules, see
            [Transitioning to the New UI Layout System](https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/Transitioning_to_the_New_UI_Layout_System)
            in the Titanium Mobile Guides.

         *  `vertical`. Children are laid out vertically from top to bottom. The first child
            is laid out `top` units from its parent's bounding box. Each subsequent child is
            laid out below the previous child. The space between children is equal to the
            upper child's `bottom` value plus the lower child's `top` value.

            Each child is positioned horizontally as in the composite layout mode.

         *  `horizontal`. Horizontal layouts have different behavior depending on whether wrapping
            is enabled. Wrapping is enabled by default (the `horizontalWrap` property is `true`).

            With wrapping behavior, the children are laid out horizontally from left to right,
            _in rows_. If a child requires more horizontal space than exists in the current row,
            it is wrapped to a new row. The height of each row is equal to the maximum height of
            the children in that row.

            Wrapping behavior is available on iOS and Android. When the `horizontalWrap` property is
            set to true, the first row is placed at the top of the parent view, and successive rows
            are placed below the first row. Each child is positioned vertically _within its row_ somewhat
            like composite layout mode. In particular:

            *   If neither `top` or `bottom` is specified, the child is centered in the
                row.
            *   If either `top` or `bottom` is specified, the child is aligned to either
                the top or bottom of the row, with the specified amount of padding.
            *   If *both* `top` and `bottom` is specified for a given child, the properties
                are both treated as padding.

            If the `horizontalWrap` property is false, the behavior is more equivalent to a vertical layout.
            Children are laid or horizontally from left to right in a single row. The `left` and
            `right` properties are used as padding between the children, and the `top` and `bottom`
            properties are used to position the children vertically.

            Defaults to Composite layout.
