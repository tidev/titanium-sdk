events:
  - name: click
    summary: Fired when the device detects a click against the view.
    description: |
        There is a subtle difference between singletap and click events.

        A singletap event is generated when the user taps the screen briefly
        without moving their finger. This gesture will also generate a click event.

        However, a click event can also be generated when the user touches, 
        moves their finger, and then removes it from the screen.

        On Android, a click event can also be generated by a trackball click.

    summary: Fired when the device detects a long click.
    description: |
        A long click is generated by the user touching and holding on a touchscreen or,
        in the case of a trackball, holding down the button.  The event occurs before the
        finger/button is lifted up again.  If you have a longclick listener then the click
        event will not occur when you lift the finger/button after a long click.

    summary: Fired when the device detects a long press.
    description: |
        A long press is generated by the user touching and holding on a touchscreen.
        The event occurs before the finger is lifted again.  Both a `longpress`
        and a `longclick` can occur together.  The differences are that `longclick` 
        can be generated with the trackball whereas `longpress` is a touch-only event, 
        and `longpress` includes `x` and `y` coordinates.

    summary: Size of the left end cap.
    description: |
        End caps specify the portion of an image that should not be resized when an 
        image is stretched. This technique is used to implement buttons and other 
        resizable image-based interface elements. When a button with end caps is resized, 
        the resizing occurs only in the middle of the button, in the region between the end 
        caps. The end caps themselves keep their original size and appearance. This property 
        specifies the size of the left end cap. The middle (stretchable) portion is assumed to 
        be 1 pixel wide. The right end cap is therefore computed by adding the size of the left 
        end cap and the middle portion together and then subtracting that value from the width

    type: [Number,String]
  - name: layout
    type: String
    summary: |
        Specifies how the view positions its children. 
        One of: 'absolute', 'vertical', or 'horizontal'.
    description: |
        There are three layout options:
        *    `absolute`. Default layout. A child view's `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` 
             properties are interpreted as absolute values in the parent's coordinate space.

             If the child includes a `top` value and **not** a `bottom` value, the child is 
             positioned `top` units from the top of the parent's bounding box, and its height
             is set based on its `height` property.

             If the child includes a `bottom` value and **not** a `top` value, the child is 
             positioned `bottom` units from the bottom of the parent's bounding box. Its height
             is set based on its `height` property.

             If the child includes both `top` and `bottom` values, the behavior is 
             platform-specific.
             
             Similar calculations are used for `left` and `right`. 

             You can also position a child by setting its `center` property to a <Point>.

             If no position is set explicitly, children are centered. For example, if a 
             child specifies a `top` of 20 and does not specify any other position properties,
             the child is positioned 20 units from the parent's top, and centered horizontally.

         *   `vertical`. Children are laid out vertically from top to bottom. The first child 
             is laid out `top` units from its parent's bounding box. Each subsequent child is 
             laid out below the previous child. The space between children is equal to the 
             upper child's `bottom` value plus the lower child's `top` value.

             Each child is positioned horizontally as for the absolute layout mode.

         *   `horizontal`. Like vertical layout, except children are laid out horizontally
             from left ot right, using the `left` and `right` values to determine spacing.

             Each child is positioned vertically as in the absolute layout mode.
