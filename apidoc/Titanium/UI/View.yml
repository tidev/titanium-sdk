name: Titanium.UI.View
summary: An empty drawing surface or container created by the method <Titanium.UI.createView>.
extends: Titanium.Proxy
since: "0.9"
methods:
  - name: add
    summary: Adds a child to this view's hierarchy.
    description: |
        There are certain top-level containers that are not intended to be added 
        as the children of other views. These top-level containers include 
        [Window](Titanium.UI.Window), [SplitWindow](Titanium.UI.iPad.SplitWindow) 
        and [TabGroup](Titanium.UI.TabGroup). Other types of views must be added
        to a top-level container in order to be displayed on screen.

        The special containers [NavigationGroup](Titanium.UI.iPhone.NavigationGroup), 
        [SplitWindow](Titanium.UI.iPad.SplitWindow), and [TabGroup](Titanium.UI.TabGroup)
        manage windows. These managed windows may be referred to as *children* of the 
        container, but they are not added using the `add` method.
        
        Note that although a `NavigationGroup`
        manages windows, it is not itself top-level container.  It must be added to a 
        `Window` in order to be displayed.

        if their window is blurred or if the view is offscreen (such as in some situations with <Titanium.UI.ScrollableView>).
        If this view is a <Titanium.UI.ScrollView>, the view's x and y offsets are subtracted from the return value.
