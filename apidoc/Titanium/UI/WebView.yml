    Creating webviews are more expensive than creating pure native views because of the requirement to
    load the HTML browser into memory.
    
    Since a webview internally wants to handle its own events, scrolling and other related touch events against it's own view surface, you cannot have both Titanium style events against the webview instance and internal Javascript events in the DOM.  You must choose between one or the other.
examples:
  - title: Basic Web View to external URL example
    example: |
        Create a web view to a remote URL and open the window as modal.
        
            	var webview = Titanium.UI.createWebView({url:'http://www.appcelerator.com'});
            	var window = Titanium.UI.createWindow();
            	window.add(webview);
            	window.open({modal:true});
