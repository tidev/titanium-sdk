name: Titanium.UI.WebView
summary: |
    The web view allows you to open an HTML5 based view which can load either local or remote content.
description: |
    Use the <Titanium.UI.createWebView> method or **`<WebView>`** Alloy element to create a web view.

    Web views are more expensive to create than other native views because of the requirement to
    load the HTML browser into memory.

    The web view content can be any valid web content such as HTML, PDF, SVG or other WebKit supported
    content types.

    #### JavaScript Context in WebViews--Local vs. Remote Content

    JavaScript in the web view executes in its own context.  The web view can interact with this
    content, but most of this functionality is limited to local content.

    **Local Scripts**

    When running local web content
    (that is, content that is included in the application's resources), scripts have
    access to the Titanium namespace. In particular, when running local web content:

    - You can use <Titanium.App.addEventListener> and
      <Titanium.App.fireEvent> to receive and send application-level events.

    - Events can be logged using the <Titanium.API> logging methods.

    **Remote Scripts**

    Scripts downloaded from remote web servers cannot access the Titanium namespace.

    To interact with remote content, wait until the content is loaded, then use the
    [evalJS](Titanium.UI.WebView.evalJS) method to execute a JavaScript expression
    inside the web view and retrieve the value of an expression.

    #### Local JavaScript Files

    During the build process for creating a package, all JavaScript files, that is, any file with a
    '.js' extension, are removed and their content is encrypted and obfuscated into one resource,
    causing these files to not load properly in a WebView if they are loaded externally.

    For JavaScript files referenced in static local HTML files, these JavaScript files are omitted
    from processing and left intact, which means they can be correctly loaded in the WebView.

    For local JavaScript files not referenced in static local HTML files, for example, a
    dynamically-generated HTML file referencing a local JavaScript file,
    rename the file extension of the local JavaScript files to '.jslocal' instead of '.js'.

    The build process for testing your application on the simulator, emulator or device does not
    affect the loading of local JavaScript files.

    #### iOS Platform Implementation Notes

    On the iOS platform, the native web view handles scrolling and other related touch
    events internally. If you add event listeners on the web view **or its parent views**
    for any of the standard touch events (`touchstart`, `click`, and so on), these events
    do not reach the native web view, and the user will not be able to scroll, zoom, click
    on links, and so on. To prevent this default behavior, set
    [willHandleTouches](Titanium.UI.WebView.willHandleTouches) to `false`.

    In other words, you can have either Titanium-style events against the
    web view instance, or internal JavaScript events in the DOM, but not both.

    #### Android Platform Implementation Notes

    **Android 4.4 and Later Support**

    Starting with Android 4.4 (API Level 19), the WebView component is based off of Chromium,
    introducing a number of changes to its rendering engine.  Web content may look or behave
    differently depending on the Android version.  The WebView does not
    have full feature parity with Chrome for Android.

    By default, the Chromium WebView uses hardware acceleration, which may cause content to
    fail to render. If the WebView fails to render the content, the web view will clear
    itself, displaying only the default background color. The following log messages will be
    displayed in the console:

    ```
    [WARN] :   AwContents: nativeOnDraw failed; clearing to background color.
    [INFO] :   chromium: [INFO:async_pixel_transfer_manager_android.cc(56)]
    ```

    To workaround this issue, you can enable software rendering by setting the WebView's
    [borderRadius](Titanium.UI.WebView.borderRadius) property to a value greater than zero.

    If you are developing local HTML content and size your elements using percentages, the WebView may
    not calculate the sizes correctly when hardware acceleration is enabled, resulting in the same
    behavior previously mentioned.

    To workaround this issue, you can use the previously mentioned workaround to enable software
    rendering, use absolute size values or use the
    [onresize](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.onresize) event to set the
    heights of the components.  For example, if you have a div element with an id set to `component`
    that needs to use the entire web view, the following callback resizes the content to use the
    full height of the web view:

    ``` js
    window.onresize= function(){
        document.getElementById("component").style.height = window.innerHeight + 'px';
    };
    ```

    For more information, see the following topics:

      * [Android Developers: Migrating to WebView in Android 4.4](https://developer.android.com/guide/webapps/migrating.html)
      * [Google Chrome: WebView for Android](https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/webview/overview)

    **Plugin Support**

    The Android web view supports native plugins.

    To use plugin content, you must set the [pluginState](Titanium.UI.WebView.pluginState) property
    to either [WEBVIEW_PLUGINS_ON](Titanium.UI.Android.WEBVIEW_PLUGINS_ON) or
    [WEBVIEW_PLUGINS_ON_DEMAND](Titanium.UI.Android.WEBVIEW_PLUGINS_ON_DEMAND).

    You must also call [pause](Titanium.UI.WebView.pause) when the current activity is
    paused, to prevent plugin content from continuing to run in the background. Call
    [resume](Titanium.UI.WebView.resume) when the current activity is resumed. You can
    do this by adding listeners for the [Activity.pause](Titanium.Android.Activity.pause)
    and [Activity.resume](Titanium.Android.Activity.resume) events.

    **Accessing Cookies**

    On Android, the web view uses the system cookie store which does not share cookies with the
    <Titanium.Network.HTTPClient> cookie store. Developers can manage their cookies for both
    cookie stores using the methods <Titanium.Network.addHTTPCookie>, <Titanium.Network.addSystemCookie>,
    <Titanium.Network.getHTTPCookies>, <Titanium.Network.getHTTPCookiesForDomain>, <Titanium.Network.getSystemCookies>,
    <Titanium.Network.removeHTTPCookie>, <Titanium.Network.removeHTTPCookiesForDomain>, <Titanium.Network.removeAllHTTPCookies>,
    <Titanium.Network.removeSystemCookie>, <Titanium.Network.removeAllSystemCookies>.
    
    **WKWebView**
    
    With Titanium SDK 8.0.0, we now use WKWebView to implement Ti.UI.WebView (as Apple has deprecated UIWebView).
    WKWebView has few restriction specially with local file accessing. For supporting custom-fonts with WKWebView 
    a little modification is required in the HTML files:
    
    ``` html
    <style>
      @font-face
        {
          font-family: 'Lato-Regular';
          src: url('fonts/Lato-Regular.ttf');
        }
    </style>
    ```

    To have a WKWebView scale the page the same way as UIWebView, add the following meta tag to the HTML header:

    ``` html
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      </head>
    </html>
    ```

    ### Ti.UI.SIZE and WebViews

    With Titanium 8.0.0+, <Titanium.UI.SIZE> does not work for WebViews. We recommend to give a **fixed height** 
    to <Titanium.UI.WebView> (as noted in [TIDOC-3355](https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/TIDOC-3355)).
    
    As a workaround you can try to get the `document.body.scrollHeight` inside <Titanium.UI.WebView.load> event 
    of webview and set the height to webview. See following example.

    ``` js
    var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
      backgroundColor: 'white';
    });

    var verticalView = Ti.UI.createView({layout: 'vertical', width: "100%", height: "100%"});

    verticalView.add(Ti.UI.createLabel({text: 'Label 1', top: 30, width: Ti.UI.SIZE, height: Ti.UI.SIZE}));

    var htmla = "<div style='font-family: Helvetica Neue; font-size:16px'><ul><li>Item 1</li><li>Item 2</li></ul></div>";
    var html = "<!DOCTYPE html>";
  
    html += "<html><head><meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0'><style type='text/css'>html {-webkit-text-size-adjust: none;}</style><script type='text/javascript'>document.ontouchmove = function(event){event.preventDefault();}</script></head><body style='overflow: hidden'>";
    html += htmla;
    html += "</body></html>";
  
    var webview = Ti.UI.createWebView({left: '14dp', right: '14dp', top: '7dp', height: Ti.UI.SIZE, html: html, backgroundColor: "yellow"});
  
    verticalView.add(webview);

    verticalView.add(Ti.UI.createLabel({text: 'Label 2', top: 30, width: Ti.UI.SIZE, height: Ti.UI.SIZE}));

    win.add(verticalView);

    win.open();

    webview.addEventListener('load', function(e) {
      var result = webview.evalJSSync('document.body.scrollHeight');
      Ti.API.info('webview height: ' + result);
      webview.height = result;
    });
    ```

    summary: Sets the value of [html](Titanium.UI.WebView.html) property.
    description: |
      The `options` parameter can be used to specify two options that affect
      the WebView main content presentation:

      *  `baseURL`. Sets the URL that the web content's paths will be relative to.
      *  `mimeType`. Sets the MIME type for the content. Defaults to "text/html" if not specified.

      For example:

      ``` js
      setHtml('<html><body>Hello, <a href="/documentation">Titanium</a>!</body></html>',
              { baseURL: 'https://developer.appcelerator.com/' });
      ```

    returns:
        type: Boolean

  - name: canGoForward
    summary: Returns `true` if the web view can go forward in its history list.
    returns:
        type: Boolean

  - name: evalJS
    summary: |
        Evaluates a JavaScript expression inside the context of the web view and
        optionally, returns a result. If a callback function is passed in as second argument,
        the evaluation will take place asynchronously and the the callback function will be called with the result.
    description: |
        The JavaScript expression must be passed in as a string. If you are passing in any objects,
        you must serialize them to strings using [stringify](Global).

        The `evalJS` method returns a string representing the value of the expression. For
        example, the following call retrieves the `document.title` element from the
        document currently loaded into the web view.

        ``` js
        var docTitle = myWebView.evalJS('document.title');
        ```

        It is not necessary to include `return` in the JavaScript. In fact, the following
        call returns the empty string:

        ``` js
        myWebView.evalJS('return document.title');
        ```

        The `evalJS` variant with a second callback argument executes asynchronously.

        ``` js
        myWebView.evalJS('document.title', function (result) {
          // Manipulate the result here
        });
        ```
    returns:
        type: String
        summary: Result of the evaluation. May be null if the asynchronous variant of this method is called.

    summary: |
        A Boolean value that determines whether pressing on a link displays a preview of the
        destination for the link.
    description: |
        This property is available on devices that support 3D Touch. Default value is `false`.

        If you set this value to `true` for a web view, users (with devices that support 3D Touch)
        can preview link destinations, and can preview detected data such as addresses, by pressing on links.
        Such previews are known to users as peeks. If a user presses deeper, the preview navigates (or pops,
        in user terminology) to the destination. Because pop navigation switches the user from your app to
        Safari, it is opt-in, by way of this property, rather default behavior for this class.

    description: |
        Use this property to change the resources the web view has access to when loading the content of a local file.
        By default the web view only has access to files inside the same directory as the loaded file. To reference
        resources from other directories (e.g. a parent directory) change this property accordingly.

        If assetsDirectory references a single file, only that file may be loaded. If assetsDirectory references a
        directory, files inside that directory may be loaded.

        This property needs to be set before [url](Titanium.UI.WebView.url) is assigned to a local file.

  - name: onCreateWindow
    summary: |
        Callback function called when there is a request for the application to create a new window
        to host new content.
    description: |
        For example, the request is triggered if a web page wants to open a URL in a new
        window.  By default, Titanium will open a new full-size window to host the new content.
        Use the callback to override the default behavior.

        The callback needs to create a new WebView object to host the content in and add the WebView to the
        application UI. The callback must return either a WebView object to host the content in or `null` if
        it does not wish to handle the request.

        The callback is passed a dictionary with two boolean properties:

          * `isDialog`: set to true if the content should be opened in a dialog window rather than a
            full-size window.
          * `isUserGesture`: set to true if the user initiated the request with a gesture, such as
            tapping a link.

        The following example opens new web content in a new tab rather than a new window:

        ``` js
        var tabGroup = Ti.UI.createTabGroup(),
            win = Ti.UI.createWindow(),
            tab = Ti.UI.createTab({window: win, title: 'Start Page'}),
            webview = Ti.UI.createWebView({ url:'index.html'});

        webview.onCreateWindow = function(e) {
            var newWin = Ti.UI.createWindow(),
                newWebView = Ti.UI.createWebView(),
                newTab = Ti.UI.createTab({window: newWin, title: 'New Page'});
            newWin.add(newWebView);
            tabGroup.addTab(newTab);
            return newWebView;
        };

        win.add(webview);
        tabGroup.addTab(tab);

    type: String

  - name: userAgent
    summary: The User-Agent header used by the web view when requesting content.
    description: |
        On the iOS platform, this is not per-webview. Once you have set this property for a webview
        it will not change for same. But while creating new webview it can be changed to new user agent.

        On Android, changing the user agent after the webview has begun loading content may cause
        the webview to reload and fire multiple `load` or `beforeload` events. Developers should provide the
        user agent value in the creation properties to avoid the reload and multiple events firing.
    type: String

  - name: willHandleTouches
    summary: Explicitly specifies if this web view handles touches.
    description: |
        On the iOS platform, if this web view **or any of its parent views** have touch
        listeners, the Titanium component intercepts **all** touch events. This
        prevents the user from interacting with the native web view components.

        Set this flag to `false` to disable the default behavior. Setting this property to `false`
        allows the user to interact with the native web view and still honor any `touch` events sent to
        its parents. No `touch` events will be generated when the user interacts with the web view itself.

        Set this flag to `true` if you want to receive touch events from the web view and
        the user does not need to interact with the web content directly.

        This flag is `true` by default to retain backwards compatibility with previous
        behavior.

  - name: requestHeaders
    summary: Sets extra request headers for this web view to use on subsequent URL requests.

        The parameter will be key-value pairs: `{"Custom-field1":"value1", "Custom-field2":"value2"}`

        On Android you should avoid Calling `setRequestHeaders()` right after `createWebView()`. Use the `requestHeaders` property
        inside `createWebView()` or put it inside the window `open` event.
