name: Titanium.UI.DashboardView
summary: |
    A dashboard view is an iOS Springboard-like view of <Titanium.UI.DashboardItem> items that may 
    be deleted and reordered by the user using its built-in edit mode.
description: |
    The DashboardView is created using the <Titanium.UI.createDashboardView> method.
    
    Dashboard view's edit mode may be activated by a longpress of a <Titanium.UI.DashboardItem> item, 
    unless this behavior has been disabled by the [editable](Titanium.UI.DashboardView.editable) 
    property. As a dashboard view does not inherently provide a way to exit edit mode, this must be 
    explicitly defined.
    
    When edit mode has been activated, the item icons wobble by default to act as a visual cue. 
    This behavior may be disabled using the [wobble](Titanium.UI.DashboardView.wobble) property.
    
    If a dashboard contains more than 9 items, it will be paged into screens in a 3 x 3 formation 
    using its built-in scrollable view. A paging control is added to the bottom of the view to 
    indicate the active page.
    
    Note that a dashboard is only intended to be used in [PORTRAIT](Titanium.UI.PORTRAIT) 
    orientation mode.
