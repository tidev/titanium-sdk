name: Titanium.UI.EmailDialog
description: The Email Dialog is created by <Titanium.UI.createEmailDialog> and allows you to send in 
    application emails on behalf of the application user.
extends: Titanium.Proxy
since: "0.8"
platforms: [android, iphone, ipad]
methods:
  - name: addAttachment
    description: |
        add an attachment to the email. The attachment can either be a Blob or File object. Note: Versions before 1.7.1 will only support one attachment in Android.  Since version 1.7.1, our Android implementation will accept multiple attachments, but multiple attachments will only work if the user chooses to send via the Android Gmail app; the Android "Mail" app (which is anyway not available on some handsets) will only accept one attachment from a Titanium app.  K9 has also been tested successfully with multiple attachments.

        In this example, we send an email with a file attachment.
        
            var emailDialog = Titanium.UI.createEmailDialog()
            emailDialog.subject = "Hello from Titanium";
            emailDialog.toRecipients = ['foo@yahoo.com'];
            emailDialog.messageBody = '<b>Appcelerator Titanium Rocks!</b>';
            var f = Ti.Filesystem.getFile('cricket.wav');
            emailDialog.addAttachment(f);
