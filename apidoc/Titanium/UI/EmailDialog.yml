    The Email Dialog is created by <Titanium.UI.createEmailDialog>.
    
    On Mobile Web and Tizen, the `to` addresses, `cc` addresses, `bcc` addresses, `subject`, and `body` are 
    appended together and formatted into a `mailto:` URL. This URL typically has a limit of 
    approximately 2000 characters.

    description: |
        On Mobile Web and Tizen, as the platform cannot determine whether a message has been sent or not, 
        this event fires immediately after calling open() and always reports success.

      - name: success
        summary: |
            Indicates if the email was handled successfully.
            Returns `true` if request succeeded, `false` otherwise. Note that emails being
            deleted or saved for later do count as success.

        type: String

            Error code will be 0 if `success` is `true`, nonzero otherwise. If the error
