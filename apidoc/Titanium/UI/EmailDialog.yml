    The Email Dialog is created with the <Titanium.UI.createEmailDialog> method. The user needs to
    register an e-mail account on the device in order to open the dialog.  The dialog will not
    open when there is not a registered e-mail account.

    **iOS Platform Notes**

    On iOS, you cannot test the e-mail dialog on the iOS Simulator. Test the email dialog on device.

        attachment from a Titanium app.
