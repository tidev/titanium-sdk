notes: |
    Make sure you set the tableClass on each row instance if using more than one type of row layout. You can use the same value for each instance of a row where the layout is the same - even if the value of the elements inside the row have different values.  For example, if the text is the only thing different between two cells but the layout is the same, both row instances should have the same value for tableClass.
    
    You can listen for table row events on all rows by adding an event listener to the table view instance.  Events automatically propagate to parent views.

    example: |
        In this simple example, we create a table view row with a red square in the cell.
        
            var row = Titanium.UI.createTableViewRow();
            var view = Titanium.UI.createView({backgroundColor:'red',width:20,height:20});
            row.height = 'auto';
            row.add(view);
