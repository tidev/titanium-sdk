name: Titanium.UI.TableViewRow
summary: |
    A table view row is an individual item in a table, organized into table view sections.
description: |
    Use the <Titanium.UI.createTableViewRow> method to create a table view row. These may be 
    explicitly added to [TableViewSection](Titanium.UI.TableViewSection) objects, which are applied 
    to a [TableView](Titanium.UI.TableView). If a table section is not specified, one will be 
    automatically created. 
    
    A row's contents can be as simple as a single line of text, or comprised of a completely 
    customized layout of child views. 
    
    #### Creating Table View Rows
    
    Rows may be created using the properties directly available on the `TableViewRow` object, to 
    achieve the following:
    
    * Row title to display the text content in the row.
    * Background color and background image.
    * Images on the left and right sides of the row.
    * System decorations, such as checkboxes.
    
    Alternatively, custom layouts of multiple lines of text, different fonts, and additional 
    images or controls can be created by adding child views to the row. In this case, the row's 
    `title` property should not be set.
    
    As events automatically bubble/propogate to parent views, a listener may be placed on the table 
    view to detect events fired from the rows. The benefit is that it is not necessary to 
    explicitly create a listener for every individual row.
    
    See the [TableView](Titanium.UI.TableView) description and examples section for more information 
    about creating table rows.
    
    #### Improved Table Performance (Android and iOS)
    
    When rows contain child views, improved performance may be obtained by giving rows with the same 
    layout a [className](Titanium.UI.TableViewRow) of the same value. The content of the rows may 
    be different without the need for a new class name, though. For example, if the text is the only 
    difference between two rows, both row instances should have identical class names.
    
    #### Platform Implementation Notes
    
    The `top`, `left` and other positional parameters are not used for their usual purposes, because 
    the table view row is automatically positioned by its parent.
    
    On Android, these properties are used to position the content (title) inside the row. For example, 
    setting `top` to 20 moves the title down from the top of the row.  
    
    On iOS, these values have no effect.
    
    On Mobile Web, they are used to relatively position the row, treating the `TableView` as if it 
    were a horizontal layout.
    
    Also, note that the selected text color, `selectedColor`, can only be set on iOS and 
    Mobile Web. On Android, the text color does not change when the row is selected.
    
    #### Row Swipe Gestures (Android and iOS)
    
    A common requirement is to enable the user to interact with table rows using swipe gestures. 
    As this event is not available for the `TableViewRow` object, it will not "bubble up" to the 
    `TableView`, where a <Titanium.UI.TableView.swipe> is recognized. 
    
    A typical solution is to use a standard view as a container, or wrapper, for all each row's child 
    views, because it recognizes <Titanium.UI.View.swipe> events and allows them to pass to the table. 
    Each child view should have touch events disabled, so that the container view provides a reliable 
    source for these events. Refer to the "Row Swipe Gestures" example for a demonstration.

        On Android and iOS, be aware that a row or table touch event and a table

properties:
  - name: className
    summary: Class name for the row. 
    description: |
        A class name represents a unique row layout. 
        
        A table view row must have a unique class name if the row layout is unique. However, 
        use the same name for rows that have the same structural layout (even if the content is 
        different) to provide maximum rendering performance.
        
        For example, if some rows include images and some rows do not, you would have two class
        names, one for image rows and one for plain rows.
        
        This property exists on Mobile Web, but is ignored.
    type: String
    
  - name: color
    summary: Default text color of the row when not selected, as a color name or hex triplet.
    description: |
        For information about color values, see the "Colors" section of <Titanium.UI>. 
        
        On Android, `selectedColor` is not supported, so the text is always displayed in this color.
    type: String
    
  - name: editable
    summary: |
        Determines the rows' editable behavior, which allows them to be deleted by the user when the 
        table is in `editing` or `moving` mode.
    description: |
        If this property is not explicitly set, it will return `undefined` and the row's editable 
        behavior will be determined by its parent table's [editable](Titanium.UI.TableView.editable) 
        property.
        
        See the <Titanium.UI.TableView> description section for a full explanation of the TableView's 
        row `editing` and `moving` modes.
    type: Boolean
    default: undefined
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
    
  - name: font
    summary: Font to use for the row title.
    description: |
        If the table uses different fonts on different rows, the font properites may become 
        associated with the wrong row as the table scrolls. This is a known issue.
    type: Font
    default: System default font.
    
  - name: hasCheck
    summary: |
        Determines whether a system-provided checkmark is displayed on the right-hand side of 
        the row.
    type: Boolean
    default: false
    
  - name: hasChild
    summary: |
        Determines whether a system-provided arrow is displayed on the right-hand side of the row.
    description: |
        The `hasChild` flag is used to indicate to the user that clicking on the row displays more 
        detailed information.  
        
        On iOS, this is specifically used when clicking on the row navigates to the next table view 
        in a heirarchy of table views.
    type: Boolean
    default: false
    
  - name: hasDetail
    summary: |
        Determines whether a system-provided detail disclosure button is displayed on the right-hand 
        side of the row.
    description: |
        The `hasDetail` flag is used to indicate to the user that more details are
        available on the row.  
        
        Specifically on iOS the detail disclosure button indicates that clicking on the row results 
        in a detail view of that item. 
        
        The `detail` property in the click event is set to `true` if the click occurred on
        the detail button itself, `false` if the click occurs anywhere else in the row.
        
        For rows that have `hasDetail` set to false, the `detail` flag is always `false`.
    type: Boolean
    default: false

  - name: indentionLevel
    summary: Indention level for the row.
    description: Indentation values greater than 0 indent the row text.

    summary: Image to render in the left image area of the row, specified as a local path or URL.
    type: String

  - name: moveable
    summary: |
        Determines the rows' moveable behavior, which allows them to be re-ordered by the user when 
        the table is in `editing` or `moving` mode.
    description: |
        If this property is not explicitly set, it will return `undefined` and the row's moveable 
        behavior will be determined by its parent table's [moveable](Titanium.UI.TableView.moveable) 
        property.
