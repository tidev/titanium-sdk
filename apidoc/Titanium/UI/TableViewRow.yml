name: Titanium.UI.TableViewRow
summary: An individual row for a [TableView](Titanium.UI.TableView). 
description: |
    Use the <Titanium.UI.createTableViewRow> method to create a table view row.

    A table view row represents a single item in a `TableView`. The row's contents can be 
    as simple as a single line of text, or the row can be a completely customized with
    its own child views.

    A basic table view row includes properties for setting:

    * Row title--the text displayed on the row.
    * Optional images on the left and right sides of the row.
    * Optional system decorations, such as checkboxes.

    You can also set the usual view properties, such as background color and 
    background image.

    If you want a custom layout for your view, such as multiple lines of text,
    different fonts, or additional images or controls, you can add child views
    to the row. In this case, you should not specify a `title` for the row.

    Make sure you set the `className` on each row instance if using more than one type 
    of row layout. You can use the same value for each instance of a row where the 
    layout is the same - even if the value of the elements inside the row have different 
    values. For example, if the text is the only thing different between two cells but 
    the layout is the same, both row instances should have the same value for `className`.
    
    You can listen for table row events on all rows by adding an event listener to the 
    table view instance.  Events automatically propagate to parent views.

    #### Platform Implementation Notes

    The `top`, `left` and other positional parameters are not used for their usual
    purposes, because the table view row is automatically positioned by its parent.
    
    On Android, these properties are used to position the content (title) inside the row. 
    For example, setting `top` to 20 moves the title down from the top of the row. 
    On iOS, these values have no effect.
    
    On Mobile Web, these properties are used to relatively position the row, treating
    the `TableView` as if it were a horizontal layout.

    Also, note that the selected text color, `selectedColor`, can only be set on iOS. On
    Android, the text color does not change when the row is selected.

properties:
  - name: className
    summary: Class name for the row. 
    description: |
        A class name represents a unique row layout. 
        
        A table view row must have a unique class name if the row layout is unique. However, 
        use the same name for rows that have the same structural layout (even if the content is 
        different) to provide maximum rendering performance.

        For example, if some rows include images and some rows do not, you would have two class
        names, one for image rows and one for plain rows.
        
        This property exists on Mobile Web, but is ignored.
    type: String
  - name: color
    summary: Default text color of the row when not selected.
    description: |
        On Android, `selectedColor` is not supported, so the text is always displayed
        in this color.
    type: String
  - name: editable
    summary: Whether or not this row can be deleted when the table is in edit mode.
    type: Boolean
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
    default: true
  - name: font
    summary: Font to use for the row title.
    description: |
        If the table uses different fonts on different rows, the font properites may become 
        associated with the wrong row as the table scrolls. This is a known issue.

        Because this property is Android-only, adding a [Label](Titanium.UI.Label) to a 
        table view row is a more portable and versatile alternative to using this property.
    type: Font
    default: System default font.
    platforms: [android]
  - name: hasCheck
    summary: Render a system provided check mark in the right image area of the row.
    type: Boolean
    default: false
  - name: hasChild
    summary: Render a system provided arrow in the right image area of the row.
    description: |
        The `hasChild` flag is used to indicate to the user that clicking on the row 
        displays more detailed information. On iOS, this is specifically used when 
        clicking on the row navigates to the next table view in a heirarchy of table views.
    type: Boolean
    default: false
  - name: hasDetail
    summary: Render a system provided detail disclosure button in the right image area of the row.
    description: |
        The `hasDetail` flag is used to indicate to the user that more details are
        available on the row. Specifically on iOS the detail disclosure button indicates
        that clicking on the row results in a detail view of that item. 

        The `detail` property in the click event is set to `true` if the click occurred on
        the detail button itself, `false` if the click occurs anywhere else in the row.
        
        For rows that have `hasDetail` set to false, the `detail` flag is always `false`.
    type: Boolean
    default: false

    example: |
        In this simple example, we create a table view row with a red square in the cell.
        
            var row = Titanium.UI.createTableViewRow();
            var view = Titanium.UI.createView({backgroundColor:'red',width:20,height:20});
            row.height = 'auto';
            row.add(view);
