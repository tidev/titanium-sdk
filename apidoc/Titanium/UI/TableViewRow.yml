name: Titanium.UI.TableViewRow
summary: |
    A table view row is an individual item in a table, organized into table view sections.
description: |
    Use the <Titanium.UI.createTableViewRow> method or **`<TableViewRow>`** Alloy element to create
    a table view row.

    These may be explicitly added to [TableViewSection](Titanium.UI.TableViewSection) objects, which are applied
    to a [TableView](Titanium.UI.TableView). If a table section is not specified, one will be
    automatically created.

    A row's contents can be as simple as a single line of text, or comprised of a completely
    customized layout of child views.

    #### Creating Table View Rows

    Rows may be created using the properties directly available on the `TableViewRow` object, to
    achieve the following:

    * Row title to display the text content in the row.
    * Background color and background image.
    * Images on the left and right sides of the row.
    * System decorations, such as checkboxes.

    Alternatively, custom layouts of multiple lines of text, different fonts, and additional
    images or controls can be created by adding child views to the row. In this case, the row's
    `title` property should not be set.

    As events automatically bubble/propogate to parent views, a listener may be placed on the table
    view to detect events fired from the rows. The benefit is that it is not necessary to
    explicitly create a listener for every individual row.

    See the [TableView](Titanium.UI.TableView) description and examples section for more information
    about creating table rows.

    #### Improved Table Performance (Android)

    If you are experiencing performance issues on Android when using custom rows, you can
    try setting the [className](Titanium.UI.TableViewRow.className) property. The class name serves as a
    cue for reusing the underlying views used to display the rows.

    A given `className` value indicates a row with a particular set of child views.
    All rows that share a class name must have the same set of children -- for example, the class
    name "myCustomRow" could identify a row containing two labels and an image view.

    The properties of the child controls may be different. For example, each instance of
    "myCustomRow" could have a different image and different text on the labels.

    Note that `className` is no longer used on iOS, and is ignored.

    #### Platform Implementation Notes

    The `top`, `left` and other positional parameters are not used for their usual purposes, because
    the table view row is automatically positioned by its parent.

    On Android, these properties are used to position the content (title) inside the row. For example,
    setting `top` to 20 moves the title down from the top of the row.

    On iOS, these values have no effect.

    Also, note that the selected text color, `selectedColor`, can only be set on iOS.
    On Android, the text color does not change when the row is selected.

    #### Row Swipe Gestures (Android and iOS)

    A common requirement is to enable the user to interact with table rows using swipe gestures.
    As this event is not available for the `TableViewRow` object, it will not "bubble up" to the
    `TableView`, where a <Titanium.UI.TableView.swipe> is recognized.

    A typical solution is to use a standard view as a container, or wrapper, for all each row's child
    views, because it recognizes <Titanium.UI.View.swipe> events and allows them to pass to the table.
    Each child view should have touch events disabled, so that the container view provides a reliable
    source for these events. Refer to the "Row Swipe Gestures" example for a demonstration.

    For iOS, read the [Row Editing and Moving Modes notes on TableView](Titanium.UI.TableView) regarding
    the interactions between edit modes and swipes.

properties:

    summary: Class name for the row.
    description: |
        A class name represents a unique row layout.

        A table view row must have a unique class name if the row layout is unique. However,
        use the same name for rows that have the same structural layout (even if the content is
        different) to provide maximum rendering performance.

        For example, if some rows include images and some rows do not, you would have two class
        names, one for image rows and one for plain rows.

        This property exists on iOS, but is ignored.
    type: String
    platforms: [android]

  - name: color
    summary: Default text color of the row when not selected, as a color name or hex triplet.
    description: |
        For information about color values, see the "Colors" section of <Titanium.UI>.

        On Android, the default text color is black if the background color is closer to white
        otherwise the default text color is white also `selectedColor` is not supported
        so the text is always displayed in this color.
    type: [String, Titanium.UI.Color]

  - name: deleteButtonTitle
    summary: Text to display on the delete button when editable is enabled
    description: When [editable](Titanium.UI.TableViewRow.editable) is enabled on the TableViewRow, use this property to change the title of the delete button.
    type: String

  - name: editable
    summary: |
        Determines the rows' editable behavior, which allows them to be deleted by the user when the
        table is in `editing` or `moving` mode.
    description: |
        If this property is not explicitly set, it will return `undefined` and the row's editable
        behavior will be determined by its parent table's [editable](Titanium.UI.TableView.editable)
        property.

        See the <Titanium.UI.TableView> description section for a full explanation of the TableView's
        row `editing` and `moving` modes.

        If you want to change the title of the delete button, use the [deleteButtonTitle](Titanium.UI.TableViewRow.deleteButtonTitle] property
    type: Boolean
    default: undefined
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]

  - name: font
    summary: Font to use for the row title.
    type: Font
    default: System default font.

  - name: footer
    summary: The footer title of the row.
    description: |
        The `footer` property is used to assign a footer title to a row. It has the same effect as setting
        the `footerTitle` property of a <Titanium.UI.TableViewSection>.
    type: String
    platforms: [iphone, ipad, android]

  - name: hasCheck
    summary: |
        Determines whether a system-provided checkmark is displayed on the right-hand side of

    type: Boolean
    default: false

  - name: hasChild
    summary: |
        Determines whether a system-provided arrow is displayed on the right-hand side of the row.
    description: |
        The `hasChild` flag is used to indicate to the user that clicking on the row displays more
        detailed information.

        On iOS, this is specifically used when clicking on the row navigates to the next table view
        in a heirarchy of table views.
    type: Boolean
    default: false

  - name: hasDetail
    summary: |
        Determines whether a system-provided detail disclosure button is displayed on the right-hand
        side of the row.
    description: |
        The `hasDetail` flag is used to indicate to the user that more details are
        available on the row.

        Specifically on iOS the detail disclosure button indicates that clicking on the row results
        in a detail view of that item.

        The `detail` property in the click event is set to `true` if the click occurred on
        the detail button itself, `false` if the click occurs anywhere else in the row.

        For rows that have `hasDetail` set to false, the `detail` flag is always `false`.

  - name: moveable
    summary: |
        Determines the rows' moveable behavior, which allows them to be re-ordered by the user when
        the table is in `editing` or `moving` mode.
    description: |
        If this property is not explicitly set, it will return `undefined` and the row's moveable
        behavior will be determined by its parent table's [moveable](Titanium.UI.TableView.moveable)
        property.

        See the <Titanium.UI.TableView> description section for a full explanation of the TableView's
        row `editing` and `moving` modes.
