name: Titanium.UI.ActivityIndicator
summary: An activity indicator that lets the user know an action is taking place. 
    
description:  |
    An activity indicator can be used to show the progress of an operation in the UI to let the user know some action is taking place. An activity indicator consists of a spinning animation and an optional text message, and is used to indicate an ongoing activity of indeterminate length. To show progress, use <Titanium.UI.ProgressBar> instead.

    Use the <Titanium.UI.createActivityIndicator> method to create an Activity Indicator. 
    
    Activity indicators must be used differently on Android and iOS. On Android, the activity indicator is a modal dialog that blocks the UI. Calling `show` displays the indicator, and calling `hide` removes it. On iOS, the activity indicator is a view like any other view, and must be added to a window or other top-level view before it can be shown.

    example: |
        In this example, we create a basic activity indicator and start it.
        
            var actInd = Titanium.UI.createActivityIndicator({
            	height:50,
            	width:10
            });
            actInd.show();
  - title: Simple Activity Indicator (iOS)
    example: |
        In iOS, the activity indicator must be added to a window or another view to appear.
        
            var actInd = Titanium.UI.createActivityIndicator({
                bottom:10,
            	height:50,
            	width:10
            });
            win.add(actInd);
            actInd.show();
