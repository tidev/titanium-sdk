name: Titanium.UI.Matrix3D
summary:  The 3D Matrix is an object for holding values for a 3D affine transform.
description: |
    The 3D Matrix is created by <Titanium.UI.createMatrix3D>. A 3D transform is
    used to rotate, scale, translate, or skew the objects in three-dimensional
    space. A 3D transform  is represented by a 4 by 4 matrix.

    You create an `identity matrix` by creating a 3D Matrix with an empty
    constructor.
extends: Titanium.Proxy
since: "8.0.0"
platforms: [iphone, ipad, macos]

methods:
  - name: invert
    summary: Returns a matrix constructed by inverting this matrix.
    returns:
        type: Titanium.UI.Matrix3D

  - name: multiply
    summary: Returns a matrix constructed by combining two existing matrix.
    description: |
        The result of this function is the first matrix multiplied by the second matrix. You might perform
        several multiplications in order to create a single matrix that contains the cumulative effects of
        several transformations. Note that matrix operations are not commutative - the order in which
        you concatenate matrices is important. That is, the result of multiplying matrix t1 by matrix t2
        does not necessarily equal the result of multiplying matrix t2 by matrix t1.
    returns:
        type: Titanium.UI.Matrix3D
    parameters:
      - name: t2
        summary: Matrix to concatenate to this matrix.

        type: Number
      - name: x
        summary: The x part of the vector about which to rotate.
        type: Number

examples:
  - title: Apply a 3D Matrix to a Label
    example: |
        Move a label through a translation that repositions it from 100px to 200px from the top of
        the display.

        ``` js
        var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
          backgroundColor: 'white'
        });

        var label = Ti.UI.createLabel({
          font: { fontSize : 50 },
          text: 'Titanium',
          textAlign: 'center',
          top: 100
        });
        win.add(label);

        var button = Ti.UI.createButton({
          title: 'Animate',
          bottom: 20,
          width: 200,
          height: 40
        });
        win.add(button);

        button.addEventListener('click', function() {
          var t1 = Ti.UI.createMatrix3D();
          t1 = t1.translate(0, 100, 200);
          t1.m34 = 1.0 / -90.0;
          var a1 = Ti.UI.createAnimation();
          a1.transform = t1;
          a1.duration = 800;
          label.animate(a1);
