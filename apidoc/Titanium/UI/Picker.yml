    Use the <Titanium.UI.createPicker> method or Alloy **`<Picker>`** element to create a picker control.

    On Android, the `useSpinner` property must be enabled to support multiple columns.
    By default, the spinner is automatically sized to fit its content and can overflow
    to additional spinner rows. The size of the picker can be adjusted with the `width`
    and `height` properties, but may omit picker columns or cut off picker rows
    if the size is set too small. This property is deprecated. Please use the default
    Android native "dropdown" style by not setting `useSpinner` to `true`.

    On iOS, the `height` property is only available in iOS 9 and later.
    By default, the size of the picker, including its background, is fixed at the
    same height as the iPhone keyboard to respect the
    [iOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/themes/#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH15-SW3).
    The default `width` on iOS is 320px and the `height` is 228px.
    The contents of the picker are sized to fit the picker, which may cut off text
    in the picker rows. Adding views to picker rows is also supported on iOS.

    On iPad, Apple recommends using a picker only in a popover.  Since the size of the picker
    cannot be adjusted, it is not suitable for the main screen.

    **Note:** you can only set the [columns](Titanium.UI.Picker.columns) property for the plain picker.
    If you set the [type](Titanium.UI.Picker.type) property to anything else except
    `Titanium.UI.PICKER_TYPE_PLAIN`, you cannot modify the picker's columns.

    description: |
        Applicable to <Titanium.UI.PICKER_TYPE_TIME> and <Titanium.UI.PICKER_TYPE_DATE_AND_TIME> picker types.
        The picker type <Titanium.UI.PICKER_TYPE_DATE> does not support text customizing as stated in the
        [UIKit User Interface Catalog](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidatepicker).

        Important: On iOS 14+, you also have to set the <Titanium.UI.Picker.datePickerStyle> to <Titanium.UI.iOS.DATE_PICKER_STYLE_WHEELS>
        in order to use this property.

        picker types.

        When this property is enabled, a time picker is displayed with hours 0 through 23,
        or with hours 1 through 12 and am/pm controls otherwise.

        For backward compatibility, the default value of this property depends on the style of
        picker in use.

        For a spinner picker (when `useSpinner` is `true`), this defaults to `true` (24-hour format.)
        For a native picker (when `useSpinner` is either un-set or `false`), this defaults to `false`
        (12-hour format.)

        The value of this property may be modified even after a picker is rendered and the UI will be
        updated accordingly.

        var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
          exitOnClose: true,
          layout: 'vertical'
        });

        var picker = Ti.UI.createPicker({
          top:50

        var data = [];
        data[0]=Ti.UI.createPickerRow({title:'Bananas'});
        data[1]=Ti.UI.createPickerRow({title:'Strawberries'});
        data[2]=Ti.UI.createPickerRow({title:'Mangos'});
        data[3]=Ti.UI.createPickerRow({title:'Grapes'});

        picker.add(data);
        picker.selectionIndicator = true;

        win.add(picker);

            title: fruit[i]
          });

        for(var i=0, ilen=color.length; i<ilen; i++){
          var row = Ti.UI.createPickerRow({ title: color[i] });
          column2.addRow(row);
        }

        picker.add([column1,column2]);

        win.add(picker);

        win.open();

        // must be after picker has been displayed
        picker.setSelectedRow(0, 2, false); // select Mangos
