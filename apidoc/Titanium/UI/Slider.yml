    A slider lets the user select from a range of values by dragging the slider thumb.

    Use the <Titanium.UI.createSlider> method or **`<Slider>`** Alloy element to create a slider.

    #### Android Platform Implementation Notes

    On Android, the user can also maniuplate the slider using the arrow keys. For this
    reason, placing other focusable UI elements to the left or right of
    the slider is not recommended.

    On Android, both `min` and `max` must be specified for the slider to work properly.

    Earlier versions of the Titanium SDK implicitly enforced that both the [leftTrackImage](Titanium.UI.Slider.leftTrackImage) and
    [rightTrackImage](Titanium.UI.Slider.rightTrackImage) properties be specified before the properties would be honored. Beginning with
    Titanium SDK 4.0.0 this limitation has been removed. However it is recommended that either both or neither be specified.

examples:
  - title: Simple Slider
    example: |
        The following sample demonstrates creating a slider and adding a listener to
        handle the change events.

        ``` js
        var slider = Titanium.UI.createSlider({
            top: 50,
            min: 0,
            max: 100,
            width: Ti.UI.FILL,
            value: 50
            });

        var label = Ti.UI.createLabel({
            text: slider.value,
            width: Ti.UI.FILL,
            top: 30,
            left: 0,
            textAlign: Ti.UI.TEXT_ALIGNMENT_CENTER
        });

        slider.addEventListener('change', function(e) {
            label.text = String.format('%3.1f', e.value);
        });
        ```

  - title: Alloy XML Markup
    example: |
        Previous example as an Alloy view.

        Implement the `updateLabel` callback in the controller to update the label value
        and set the initial `text` value for the label in the TSS file or controller.

        index.xml:

        ``` xml
        <Alloy>
            <Window id="window" backgroundColor="white">
                <Slider id="slider" top="50" min="0" max="100" width="Ti.UI.FILL" value="50" onChange="updateLabel"/>
                <Label id="label" width="Ti.UI.FILL" top="30" left="0" />
            </Window>
        </Alloy>
        ```

        index.js:

        ``` js
        $.slider.text = $.slider.value;
        function updateLabel(e) {
            $.label.text = String.format('%3.1f', e.value);
        }
        $.window.open();
        ```

methods:
  - name: setValue
    summary: Sets the [value](Titanium.UI.Slider.value) property.
    description: |
        On iOS, you can specify that the value change should be animated by passing the
        optional `options` parameter.
    parameters:

      - name: value
        summary: New value for the [value](Titanium.UI.Slider.value) property.
        type: Number

      - name: options
        summary: |
            Specifies animation options. The only supported property
            for this dictionary is the `animated` flag, which specifies whether
            the value change should be animated. `animated` is false by default. Only used
            on iOS.
        type: AnimatedOptions
        optional: true
        default: "{ animated: false }"

events:
  - name: change
    summary: Fired when the value of the slider changes.
    properties:

      - name: value
        summary: New value of the slider.
        type: Number

      - name: thumbSize
        summary: |
            Dictionary with properties `width` and `height` of the size of the thumb.
            Available with custom thumb image.
        type: Size
        platforms: [android]

      - name: thumbOffset
        summary: |
            Dictionary with properties `x` and `y` of the thumb's left-top corner in
            the control. Available with custom thumb image.
        type: Point
        platforms: [android]

  - name: click
    summary: Fired when the device detects a click against the view.
    description: |
        There is a subtle difference between singletap and click events.

        A singletap event is generated when the user taps the screen briefly
        without moving their finger. This gesture will also generate a click event.

        However, a click event can also be generated when the user touches,
        moves their finger, and then removes it from the screen.

        For sliders on Android, the click event is **only** generated by a trackball click
        on the slider thumb.
    platforms: [android]
    properties:

      - name: y
        summary: Y coordinate of the event from the `source` view's coordinate system.
        type: Number

      - name: x
        summary: X coordinate of the event from the `source` view's coordinate system.
        type: Number

  - name: start

        End caps specify the portion of an image that should not be resized when an image is
        stretched. This technique is used to implement buttons and other resizable image-based
        interface elements. When an image with end caps is resized, the resizing occurs only in
        the middle of the image, in the region between the end caps. The end caps themselves keep
        their original size and appearance. This property specifies the size of the left end cap.
