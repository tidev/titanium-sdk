summary: A slider component with a draggable thumb.
description: |
    A slider lets the user select from a range of values by dragging the slider thumb. 
    
    Use the <Titanium.UI.createSlider> method to create a slider.
    
    #### Android Platform Implementation Notes

    On Android, the user can also maniuplate the slider using the arrow keys. For this
    reason, placing other focusable UI elements to the left or right of
    the slider is not recommended.

    On Android, both `min` and `max` must be specified for the slider to work properly.

  - title: Simple Slider
    example: |
        The following sample demonstrates creating a slider and adding a listener to 
        handle the change events.

            var slider = Titanium.UI.createSlider({
                top: 50,
                min: 0,
                max: 100,
                width: '100%',
                value: 50
                });
                
            var label = Ti.UI.createLabel({
                text: slider.value,
                width: '100%',
                height: 'auto',
                top: 30,
                left: 0,
                textAlign: Ti.UI.TEXT_ALIGNMENT_CENTER
                });
            
            slider.addEventListener('change', function(e) {
                label.text = String.format("%3.1f", e.value);
            });

  - title: Alloy XML Markup
    example: |
        Previous example as an Alloy view.

        Implement the `updateLabel` callback in the controller to update the label value
        and set the initial `text` value for the label in the TSS file or controller.

        sliderexample.xml:

            <Alloy>
                <Window id="win" backgroundColor="white">
                    <Slider id="slider" top="50" min="0" max="100" width="100%" value="50" onChange="updateLabel"/>
                    <Label id="label" width="100%" top="30" left="0" />
                </Window>
            </Alloy>

        sliderexample.js:

            $.slider.text = $.slider.value;
            function updateLabel(e){
                $.label.text = String.format("%3.1f", e.value);
            }

        Adding children to a `Slider` is not supported on all platforms.

        If you need to display views on top of this object, consider using 
        another view as a container for both this object and the views you want 
        to appear on top of it.

  - name: setValue
    summary: Sets the [value](Titanium.UI.Slider.value) property.
    description: |
        On iOS, you can specify that the value change should be animated by passing the 
        optional `options` parameter. 
    parameters:

      - name: value
        summary: New value for the [value](Titanium.UI.Slider.value) property.
        type: Number

      - name: options
        summary: |
            Specifies animation options. The only supported property
            for this dictionary is the `animated` flag, which specifies whether
            the value change should be animated. `animated` is false by default. Only used
            on iOS.

events:

  - name: change
    summary: Fired when the value of the slider changes.

        type: Number

      - name: thumbSize
        summary: |
            Dictionary with properties `width` and `height` of the size of the thumb. 
            Available with custom thumb image.
        platforms: [android]

      - name: thumbOffset
        summary: |
            Dictionary with properties `x` and `y` of the thumb's left-top corner in
            the control. Available with custom thumb image.
        type: Dictionary
        platforms: [android]

  - name: click
    summary: Fired when the device detects a click against the view.
    description: |
        There is a subtle difference between singletap and click events.

        A singletap event is generated when the user taps the screen briefly
        without moving their finger. This gesture will also generate a click event.

        However, a click event can also be generated when the user touches, 
        moves their finger, and then removes it from the screen.

        For sliders on Android, the click event is **only** generated by a trackball click 
        on the slider thumb.
    platforms: [android, mobileweb]

        this property is loaded before loading any of the track images

        End caps specify the portion of an image that should not be resized when an image is 
        stretched. This technique is used to implement buttons and other resizable image-based 
        interface elements. When an image with end caps is resized, the resizing occurs only in 
        the middle of the image, in the region between the end caps. The end caps themselves keep 
        their original size and appearance. This property specifies the size of the left end cap. 
        
        On iOS 5 and above the endCaps are used to compute a rectangle which is streched in 
        the strechable portion. On earlier versions of iOS the strechable portion is assumed to be 
        1 pixel wide. The right end cap is therefore computed by adding the size of the left end cap 
        and the middle portion together and then subtracting that value from the width of the image
