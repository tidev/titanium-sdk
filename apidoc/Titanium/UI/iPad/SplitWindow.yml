name: Titanium.UI.iPad.SplitWindow
summary: |
    A SplitWindow is a window that manages the presentation of two side-by-side view
    controllers.
description: |
    You use this class to implement a master-detail interface, in which the
    left-side view presents a list of items and the right-side presents details of the
    selected item. The SplitView is for use exclusively on iPad devices.

    By default, the SplitView shows both master and detail views in landscape orientation.
    When the device switches into portrait orientation, the detail view occupies the entire
    screen. The user can click a button to bring up the master view as floating, "popover"
    view. (To show the master view in both orientations, set `showMasterInPortrait` to `true`).

    Use the <Titanium.UI.iPad.createSplitWindow> method to create a SplitWindow. The
    `masterView` and `detailView` properties are required in the constructor of the
    SplitWindow and cannot be changed once set.

    The SplitWindow inherits its methods and properties from <Titanium.UI.Window>.

    The SplitWindow is a top-level window and cannot be contained within another window or view.

        This is an example of a Split Window.

            var win = Ti.UI.createWindow();

            var nav = Ti.UI.iPhone.createNavigationGroup({
               window: win
            });

            var splitwin = Ti.UI.iPad.createSplitWindow({
            	detailView:nav,
            	masterView:masterView
            });

            splitwin.addEventListener('visible',function(e)
            {
            	if (e.view == 'detail')
            	{
            		e.button.title = "Master";
            		win.leftNavButton = e.button;
            	}
            	else if (e.view == 'master')
            	{
            		win.leftNavButton = null;
            	}
            });
