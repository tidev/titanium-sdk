platforms: [ipad]
summary: A Popover is used to manage the presentation of content in a popover. 
description: |
    A popover is created using the <Titanium.UI.iPad.createPopover> method. 
    
    Popovers are used to present information temporarily, but in a way that does not take over 
    the entire screen in the way that a modal view does. The popover content is layered on top of 
    the existing content in a special type of window. The popover remains visible until the user 
    taps outside of the popover window or it is explicitly dismissed.

examples:
  - title: Simple Popover
    example: |
        In this example, we create a simple popover and position it near the button.
        
            var popover = Ti.UI.iPad.createPopover({ height: 100, width: 100 });
            popover.add(view);
            popover.show({ view: button });
  
  - title: Popover with title and nav button
    example: |
        In this example, we create a popover with a title and right navigation button.
        
            var popover = Ti.UI.iPad.createPopover({
            	width: 250, 
            	height: 100,
            	title: 'Yo Yo',
            	rightNavButton: button
            });

  - title: Alloy XML Markup
    example: |
        Previous example as an Alloy view.

        Set the `rightNavButton` property in the controller.
        Also, the controller that is creating an instance of this view needs
        to call the `show` method to make the popover appear.

            <Alloy>
                <Popover id="popover" ns="Ti.UI.iPad" width="250" height="100" title="Yo Yo" />
            </Alloy>
