        To specify a size for the image, you may pass the image as a simple dictionary, as
        defined in <CoverFlowImageType>.  If you specify a size, the size must be exact,
        not 'auto' or a percentage size.

        If the image is passed as a `File` object or file path, the filename is checked.
        If the filename includes the '@2x' string used to identify high-resolution images
        for the Retina display, the image is treated accordingly.
