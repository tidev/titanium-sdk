name: Titanium.UI.TabGroup
summary: A tabbed group of windows.
description: |
    A tab group can contain one or more [Tab](Titanium.UI.Tab) objects, each of which has an
    associated tab control that is used to bring it into focus.

    Use the <Titanium.UI.createTabGroup> method or **`<TabGroup>`** Alloy element to create a tab group
    that, in turn, contains one or more `<Tab>` elements.

    You can add tabs to the group using [addTab](Titanium.UI.TabGroup.addTab), and programmatically
    switch to a specific tab using [setActiveTab](Titanium.UI.TabGroup.setActiveTab).

    #### Platform Implementation Notes

    When using a tab group, note the following differences between platforms:

    * The tab group controls are positioned at the top of the display on Android and at the bottom
    on iOS.

    * On Android, only one tab group may exist at one time. A tab group may be closed to allow a new
    one to be opened later, but the root of the application must be a heavyweight window to prevent
    it exiting. Tabs cannot be removed from the tab group once added, and tabs cannot be reordered.

    * On iOS, more than one tab group may exist, and may be opened and closed as required.
    Each tab can contain a stack of windows, and the user can switch between them by tapping the
    tab's associated control. Tabs can be removed, and the user may (optionally) be allowed to
    reorder tabs.

    * On iOS, it is also possible to add tabs by updating the
    [tabs](Titanium.UI.TabGroup.tabs) property, and to switch active tabs by setting the
    [active](Titanium.UI.Tab.active) property on one of the tabs to `true`. Since these mechanisms
    are platform-specific, it is recommended that you use `addTab` and `setActiveTab` instead.

    * If you use the iOS-specific mechanisms, it is possible to add multiple active tabs
    to a tab group. In this case, the result of which tab is initially selected is undefined.

    description: |
        This event is fired when the current tab group's activity detects
        a back button press by the user to navigate back.

        By default this event would trigger the current activity to be finished
        and removed from the task stack. Subscribing to this event with a listener
        will prevent the default behavior. To finish the activity from your listener
        just call the `close` method of the tab group.

        using any properties set on the JavaScript object. At this point, you can call methods
        on the activity and access any properties that are set when the activity is created.

        [TABS_STYLE_BOTTOM_DEFAULT](Titanium.UI.Android.TABS_STYLE_DEFAULT) is the style that was used in Titanium
        prior to 8.0.0.GA. It displays the TabGroup with a list of Tabs at the top of the screen.

        [TABS_STYLE_BOTTOM_NAVIGATION](Titanium.UI.Android.TABS_STYLE_BOTTOM_NAVIGATION) is a style that displays

  - name: tabsTranslucent
    summary: A Boolean value that indicates whether the tab bar is translucent.
    description: |
        When the value of this property is `true`, the tab group adds a translucent effect to its background
        image or tint color. When translucency is enabled, part of the tab bar's underlying content is able
        to show through, although the amount that shows through depends on the rest of the tab bar configuration.
        For example, a background image can wholly or partially obscure the background content. Setting this
        property to NO causes the tab bar to render its bar tint color or background image on top of an opaque backdrop.

        The default value of this property is dependent on the configuration of the tab bar:
          * The default value is `true` when the tab bar does not have a custom background image.
          * The default value is `true` when a custom background image contains any transparency - that is,
            at least one pixel has an alpha value of less than 1.0.
          * The default value is `false` when the custom background image is completely opaque - that is,
            all pixels have an alpha value of 1.0.
