name: Font
summary: An abstract datatype for specifying a text font.
description: |
    Available fonts vary by platform and device. On iOS, font support depends on the OS
    version. On Android, font support depends on the OS version **and** device manufacturer.

    Note that to update the font used by a UI component, you must set the object's `font`
    property, like this:

    ``` js
    myLabel.font = {
        fontSize: 24,
        fontFamily: myFontName
    }
    ```

    Changing the `font` object after assigning it does not reliably affect the underlying UI
    component:

    ``` js
    // This may not work as expected
    myLabel.font.fontSize = 24;
    ```

    #### Custom Fonts

    Custom TrueType (.ttf) or OpenType (.otf) fonts may be embedded in an application on iOS and
    Android. (Note that you must have redistribution rights on the fonts you ship.)


    In Alloy applications, custom fonts must be placed in a "fonts" folder in the platform-specific assets folder (<strong>app/assets/android/fonts</strong>, for example).
    In classic Titanium applications, custom fonts must be placed in the **Resources/fonts** directory.

    For an example of using custom fonts, see [Custom Fonts](https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/Custom_Fonts).

properties:
  - name: fontFamily
    summary: Specifies the font family or specific font to use.
    description: |

        This can be the name of a font family (for example, "Helvetica" or "DroidSans") the base
        name of the font file (for example, "Droid_sans.ttf"), or the font's PostScript name. The
        value you specify also depends on the platform you are targeting.

        * On Android specify the font file name without its file extension (.otf or .ttf).
        For example, if you were using the "Burnstown Dam" font whose file name is
        named `burnstown_dam.ttf`, then you specify `fontFamily: 'burnstown_dam'`.

        * On iOS you use the font's [PostScript name](https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/Custom_Fonts-section-src-29004935_safe-id-Q3VzdG9tRm9udHMtRmluZGluZ2Fmb250J3NQb3N0U2NyaXB0bmFtZQ).
        For example, the PostScript name for Burnstown Dam is "BurnstownDam-Regular so you'd specify: `fontFamily: 'BurnstownDam-Regular'`.

        For an example of using a custom font, see [Custom Fonts](https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/Custom_Fonts).

        Notes:

          * Available fonts differ by platform.
          * If the requested family name does not match an existing font, the default font family is used.
          * On Android, the generic names "sans-serif," "serif," and "monospace" (or "monospaced")
            are mapped to system fonts. On iOS, only "monospace" is supported.

    type: String
    default: Uses the default system font.
  - name: fontSize
    summary: Font size, in platform-dependent units.
    description: |
        On iOS, font sizes are always specified in typographical points
        (not to be confused with the Apple "points" used for other measurements on iOS).

        On Android the default font sizing is in pixels, but the size can also
        include a unit specifier. Supported units and their specifiers are:

        * pixels (px)
        * typographical points (pt)
        * density-independent pixels (dp or dip)
        * millimeters (mm)
        * inches (in)

        For example, "16dp" specifies a size of 16 density-independent pixels.

        iOS ignores any unit specifier after the size value.

        On Windows, font sizing is in effective pixels, not actual physical pixels so you don't have to alter font sizes for different screens sizes or resolutions.
        For more information about font sizing on Windows, see [Typography Size and Scaling](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/style/typography#size-and-scaling).
    type: [ Number, String ]
    default: 15px
  - name: fontWeight
    summary: |
        Font weight. Valid values are "bold", "semibold", "normal", "thin", 
        "light" and "ultralight".
    description: |
        The "semibold", "thin", "light" and "ultralight" weights are recognized 
        on iOS only. "thin", "light" and "ultralight" are only available on iOS 8.2
        and later.
    type: String
    default: normal
  - name: fontStyle
    summary: Font style. Valid values are "italic" or "normal".
    type: String
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
    default: normal
  - name: textStyle
    summary: The text style for the font.
    description: |
        Use one of the TEXT_STYLE constants from <Titanium.UI> to set the font to a predefined system font.
        When this property is set to a valid value, all other font properties are ignored.

        Notes:
         Since SDK 9.0.0 property <Font.fontFamily> will not be ignored for iOS 11+. 
         Custom fonts can be used with this property for dynamic font management.
