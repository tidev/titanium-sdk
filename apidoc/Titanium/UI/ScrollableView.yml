name: Titanium.UI.ScrollableView
summary: |
    A view that encapsulates a horizontally-scrolling set of sub-views, navigable using its built-in 
    horizontal swipe gestures.
description: |
    Use the <Titanium.UI.createScrollableView> method to create a scrollable view.

    ScrollableView supports a visual paging control that may be enabled to indicate on-screen that 
    a view is visible.
    
    Only the `scroll` event exists on Android. To support those that are missing, event listeners 
    may be added to its child views.
    
    In a previous Titanium version for iOS, the `maxZoomScale` and `minZoomScale` properties were 
    removed for performance and parity reasons. As they still remain in <Titanium.UI.ScrollView>, 
    the equivalent functionality may be obtained by adding a ScrollView to ScrollableView. See the 
    "Simple Scrollable View with 2 Zoomable Images" example for a demonstration.
