name: Titanium.UI.ScrollableView
summary: |
    A view that encapsulates a horizontally-scrolling set of child views, known as pages, navigable 
    using its built-in horizontal swipe gestures.
description: |
    Use the <Titanium.UI.createScrollableView> method to create a scrollable view.
    
    The `ScrollableView` supports an on-screen paging control to indicate whether a previous or next 
    page exists. When the paging control is enabled on iOS or Mobile Web, by default it appears as 
    small dots on the bottom of the screen, whereas Android displays arrows on the left and 
    right-hand sides. 
    
    Only the `scroll` event exists for the `ScrollableView` on Android. To support others, child 
    views may be added to pages, and event listeners added to these views instead of the pages 
    themselves. 
    
    In a previous Titanium version for iOS, the `maxZoomScale` and `minZoomScale` properties were 
    removed for performance and parity reasons. As they still remain in <Titanium.UI.ScrollView>, 
    the equivalent functionality may be obtained by adding a `ScrollView` to `ScrollableView`. See 
    the "Simple Scrollable View with 2 Zoomable Images" example for a demonstration.
