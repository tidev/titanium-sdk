name: Titanium.UI.Tab
summary: A tab instance for a [TabGroup](Titanium.UI.TabGroup).
description: |
    A `TabGroup` tab instance. Each tab includes a button and one or more windows, which 
    holds the "contents" of the tab. Users can select a tab by clicking on the tab button.

    Use [TabGroup.setActiveTab](Titanium.UI.TabGroup.setActiveTab) to switch between tabs 
    in a tab group. The <Titanium.UI.currentTab> property provides a global reference to 
    the currently active tab. Use the <Titanium.UI.createTab> method to create a tab.
    
    The behavior of tabs and tab groups follows the platform's native navigation style, 
    which varies significantly between platforms.

    #### iOS and Mobile Web Platform Implementation Notes

    On iOS, Mobile Web and Tizen, the tab maintains a stack of windows. On Mobile Web and Tizen, the tab is 
    really just a [NavigationGroup](Titanium.UI.MobileWeb.NavigationGroup). Windows on top 
    of the stack can partially or totally obscure windows lower in the stack.  Calling 
    [open](Titanium.UI.Tab.open) opens a new window on top of the window stack. When a window 
    is closed, either by the user or by code, the window is removed from the stack, making 
    the previous window visible. The root tab window cannot be removed. 
    
    On iOS, Mobile Web and Tizen the tab controls are generally kept on screen to allow a user to 
    navigate inside the app. Tab controls are hidden when the user is performing a modal 
    task (for example, composing a message). In this case, the app should provide a button 
    in the navigation bar to return to the previous screen. On iOS, the window should also 
    be opened as modal. On iOS, The tab controls can also be hidden by opening the new window 
    with [tabBarHidden](Titanium.UI.Window.tabBarHidden) set to `true`.
    
    When closing a tab window in iOS, Mobile Web and Tizen, you should always use the 
    [Tab.close](Titanium.UI.Tab.close) method to ensure that the tab group maintains its 
    navigation state.

    #### Android Platform Implementation Notes

    On Android, the tab does not maintain a stack of windows. 
    Calling [open](Titanium.UI.Tab.open) opens a new, heavyweight window, which 
    by default covers the tab group entirely. This seems quite different from the iOS model,
    but it is the standard model for Android applications. Users can use the **Back** button 
    to close the window and return to the tab group. 

    On Android, tab windows can be closed using either
    [Tab.close](Titanium.UI.Tab.close) or [Window.close](Titanium.UI.Window.close). Since 
    no window stack is maintained, only a single window opened using
    [Tab.open](Titanium.UI.Tab.open) can be closed using `Tab.close`.

    As on iOS, the root tab window cannot be closed.

methods:
  - name: open
    summary: Opens a new window.
    description: On iOS, Mobile Web and Tizen, the new window is opened as the top window 
        in the tab's window stack. On Android, the new window is opened as a new, 
        heavyweight window, obscuring the tab group.

            Dictionary of display and animation settings to use when opening the window. 
            Identical to the `options` parameter to [Window.open](Titanium.UI.Window.open).
            iOS only supports the **animated** parameter.
        type: Object
  - name: close
    summary: Closes the top-level window for this tab. 
    description: |
        On iOS, this method should be used when closing a window opened from a tab, to
        correctly maintain the iOS tab group's navigation state. Note that the window to 
        be closed **must** be passed in as a parameter:

            myTab.close(tabWin);

        On Android, this method does **not** take a `window` parameter.

            myTab.close();

        On Mobile Web and Tizen, calling `Tab.close` is identical to calling `close` on
        the tab's current topmost window.

        On Android, if a window has been opened in front of the tab using `Tab.open`, 
        a subsequent call to `Tab.close` is equivalent to calling `close` on that window.
        No window stack is maintained, so only the most-recently opened window on a given
        tab can be closed in this way.

        All platforms accept an optional `options` parameter. The only supported property
        for this dictionary is the `animated` flag, which specifies whether the window
        close should be animated. `animated` is true by default.
    parameters: 
      - name: window

            Window to close. This parameter **must** be omitted on Android.

         The tab can be activated by setting the property, but since this property is 
         platform-specific, using [TabGroup.setActiveTab](Titanium.UI.TabGroup.setActiveTab) 
         is recommended instead.

        #### iOS Tab Icons

        On iOS, tab icons are usually white with a transparent background. The system uses
        a transparent tint color to indicate whether the tab is active or inactive. In the
        inactive state, the tint color is based on the tab bar's color
        [tabsBackgroundColor](Titanium.UI.TabGroup.tabsBackgroundColor), which defaults
        to black. In the active state, the tint color is usually blue. Prior to Titanium
        3.1, there was no way to override the default active icon tint.
        
        Titanium 3.1 introduced some new ways to customize tab icons, which are supported
        in iOS 5.0 and above:

        *   You can specify the active tab's tint color as
        [activeTabIconTint](Titanium.UI.TabGroup.activeTabIconTint).

        *   You can set separate icon images for the active and inactive states. If
        [activeIcon](Titanium.UI.Tab.activeIcon) is set, then `icon` is used in the
        inactive state, and `activeIcon` is used in the active state. **No default tint
        is applied to either icon.**

         If the icon provided is larger than [30 pixels (60 pixels in the retina variant)]
         (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/IconsImages/IconsImages.html),
         this image will be scaled to fit if used with activeIcon, and cropped at the bottom
         otherwise.
    type: String
  - name: activeIcon
    summary: Icon URL for this tab when active.
    description: |
         iOS 5.0 and later only.

         If unspecified, iOS uses a tint color to indicate the active tab. See
         [icon](Titanium.UI.Tab.icon) for more information.
         
         If the icon provided is larger than [30 pixels (60 pixels in the retina variant)]
         (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/IconsImages/IconsImages.html),
         this image will be scaled to fit.

         On iOS prior to 5.0, the default tint color is always used and this property
         remains unset.

        This is the equivalent of the [iconIsMask](Titanium.UI.Tab.iconIsmask) property, but for the active icon. When this is true, the active icon is 
        tinted with the color specified in [tabsTintColor](Titanium.UI.TabGroup.tabsTintColor). When this is false the image is rendered as is, though the 
        title of the tab is still tinted.
