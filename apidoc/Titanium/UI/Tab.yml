name: Titanium.UI.Tab
summary: A tab instance for a [TabGroup](Titanium.UI.TabGroup).
description: |
    A `TabGroup` tab instance. Each tab includes a button and one or more windows, which 
    holds the "contents" of the tab. Users can select a tab by clicking on the tab button.

    Use [TabGroup.setActiveTab](Titanium.UI.TabGroup.setActiveTab) to switch between tabs 
    in a tab group. The <Titanium.UI.currentTab> property provides a global reference to 
    the currently active tab. Use the <Titanium.UI.createTab> method to create a tab.
    
    The behavior of tabs and tab groups follows the platform's native navigation style, 
    which varies significantly between platforms.

    #### iOS and Mobile Web Platform Implementation Notes

    On iOS and Mobile Web, the tab maintains a stack of windows. On Mobile Web, the tab is 
    really just a [NavigationGroup](Titanium.UI.MobileWeb.NavigationGroup). Windows on top 
    of the stack can partially or totally obscure windows lower in the stack.  Calling 
    [open](Titanium.UI.Tab.open) opens a new window on top of the window stack. When a window 
    is closed, either by the user or by code, the window is removed from the stack, making 
    the previous window visible. The root tab window cannot be removed. 
    
    On iOS and Mobile Web the tab controls are generally kept on screen to allow a user to 
    navigate inside the app. Tab controls are hidden when the user is performing a modal 
    task (for example, composing a message). In this case, the app should provide a button 
    in the navigation bar to return to the previous screen. On iOS, the window should also 
    be opened as modal. On iOS, The tab controls can also be hidden by opening the new window 
    with [tabBarHidden](Titanium.UI.Window.tabBarHidden) set to `true`.
    
    When closing a tab window in iOS and Mobile Web, you should always use the 
    [Tab.close](Titanium.UI.Tab.close) method to ensure that the tab group maintains its 
    navigation state.

    #### Android Platform Implementation Notes

    On Android, the tab does not maintain a stack of windows. 
    Calling [open](Titanium.UI.Tab.open) opens a new, heavyweight window, which 
    by default covers the tab group entirely. This seems quite different from the iOS model,
    but it is the standard model for Android applications. Users can use the **Back** button 
    to close the window and return to the tab group. 

    On Android, tab windows can be closed using either
    [Tab.close](Titanium.UI.Tab.close) or [Window.close](Titanium.UI.Window.close). Since 
    no window stack is maintained, only a single window opened using
    [Tab.open](Titanium.UI.Tab.open) can be closed using `Tab.close`.

    As on iOS, the root tab window cannot be closed.
extends: Titanium.UI.View
since: "0.8"
methods:
  - name: open
    summary: Opens a new window.
    description: On iOS and Mobile Web, the new window is opened as the top window 
        in the tab's window stack. On Android, the new window is opened as a new, 
        heavyweight window, obscuring the tab group.
    parameters: 
      - name: window
        summary: Window to open.
        type: Titanium.UI.Window
      - name: options
        summary: Dictionary of display and animation settings to use when opening the window. Identical to the `options` parameter to [Window.open](Titanium.UI.Window.open).
        type: Object
  - name: close
    summary: Closes the top-level window for this tab. 
    description: |
        On iOS, this method should be used when closing a window opened from a tab, to
        correctly maintain the iOS tab group's navigation state. Note that the window to 
        be closed **must** be passed in as a parameter:

            myTab.close(tabWin);

        On Android, this method does **not** take a `window` parameter.

            myTab.close();

        On Mobile Web, calling `Tab.close` is identical to calling `close` on
        the tab's current topmost window.

        On Android, if a window has been opened in front of the tab using `Tab.open`, 
        a subsequent call to `Tab.close` is equivalent to calling `close` on that window.
        No window stack is maintained, so only the most-recently opened window on a given
        tab can be closed in this way.

        All platforms accept an optional `options` parameter. The only supported property
        for this dictionary is the `animated` flag, which specifies whether the window
        close should be animated. `animated` is true by default.
    parameters: 
      - name: window
        summary: |
            Window to close. This parameter **must** be omitted on Android.
        type: Titanium.UI.Window

      - name: options
        summary: Dictionary of display and animation settings to use when opening the window. Identical to the `options` parameter to [Window.close](Titanium.UI.Window.close).

  - name: active
    summary: |

    description: |
         The tab can be activated by setting the property, but since this property is 
         platform-specific, using [TabGroup.setActiveTab](Titanium.UI.TabGroup.setActiveTab) 
         is recommended instead.
