name: Titanium.UI.Tab
summary: A tab instance for a [TabGroup](Titanium.UI.TabGroup).
description: |
    A `TabGroup` tab instance. Each tab includes a button and one or more windows, which
    holds the "contents" of the tab. Users can select a tab by clicking on the tab button.

    Use the <Titanium.UI.createTab> method or **`<Tab>`** Alloy element to create a tab.

    Use [TabGroup.setActiveTab](Titanium.UI.TabGroup.setActiveTab) to switch between tabs
    in a tab group. The <Titanium.UI.currentTab> property provides a global reference to
    the currently active tab.

    The behavior of tabs and tab groups follows the platform's native navigation style,
    which varies significantly between platforms.

    #### iOS Platform Implementation Notes

    On iOS, the tab maintains a stack of windows. Windows on top
    of the stack can partially or totally obscure windows lower in the stack.  Calling
    [open](Titanium.UI.Tab.open) opens a new window on top of the window stack. When a window
    is closed, either by the user or by code, the window is removed from the stack, making
    the previous window visible. The root tab window cannot be removed.

    On iOS the tab controls are generally kept on screen to allow a user to
    navigate inside the app. Tab controls are hidden when the user is performing a modal
    task (for example, composing a message). In this case, the app should provide a button
    in the navigation bar to return to the previous screen. On iOS, the window should also
    be opened as modal. On iOS, The tab controls can also be hidden by opening the new window
    with [tabBarHidden](Titanium.UI.Window.tabBarHidden) set to `true`.

    When closing a tab window in iOS, you should always use the
    [Tab.close](Titanium.UI.Tab.close) method to ensure that the tab group maintains its
    navigation state.

    #### Android Platform Implementation Notes

    On Android, the tab does not maintain a stack of windows.
    Calling [open](Titanium.UI.Tab.open) opens a new, heavyweight window, which
    by default covers the tab group entirely. This seems quite different from the iOS model,
    but it is the standard model for Android applications. Users can use the **Back** button
    to close the window and return to the tab group.

    On Android, tab windows can be closed using either
    [Tab.close](Titanium.UI.Tab.close) or [Window.close](Titanium.UI.Window.close). Since
    no window stack is maintained, only a single window opened using
    [Tab.open](Titanium.UI.Tab.open) can be closed using `Tab.close`.

    As on iOS, the root tab window cannot be closed.

            iOS only supports the **animated** parameter.

        optional: true

  - name: close
    summary: Closes the top-level window for this tab.
    description: |
        On iOS, this method should be used when closing a window opened from a tab, to
        correctly maintain the iOS tab group's navigation state. Note that the window to
        be closed **must** be passed in as a parameter:

        ``` js
        myTab.close(tabWin);
        ```

        On Android, this method does **not** take a `window` parameter.

        ``` js
        myTab.close();
        ```

        On Android, if a window has been opened in front of the tab using `Tab.open`,
        a subsequent call to `Tab.close` is equivalent to calling `close` on that window.
        No window stack is maintained, so only the most-recently opened window on a given
        tab can be closed in this way.

        All platforms accept an optional `options` parameter. The only supported property
        for this dictionary is the `animated` flag, which specifies whether the window
        close should be animated. `animated` is true by default.
    parameters:
      - name: window
        summary: |

        #### iOS Tab Icons

        On iOS, tab icons are usually white with a transparent background. The system uses
        a transparent tint color to indicate whether the tab is active or inactive. In the
        inactive state, the tint color is based on the tab bar's color
        [tabsBackgroundColor](Titanium.UI.TabGroup.tabsBackgroundColor), which defaults
        to black. In the active state, the tint color is usually blue. Prior to Titanium
        3.1, there was no way to override the default active icon tint.

        Some icon-related features:

        *   You can specify the active tab's tint color as
        [activeTabIconTint](Titanium.UI.TabGroup.activeTabIconTint).

        *   You can set separate icon images for the active and inactive states. If
        [activeIcon](Titanium.UI.Tab.activeIcon) is set, then `icon` is used in the
        inactive state, and `activeIcon` is used in the active state. **No default tint
        is applied to either icon.**

         If the icon provided is larger than [30 pixels (60 pixels for retina, 90 pixels for super-retina)]
         (https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/icons-and-images/image-size-and-resolution/),
         this image will be scaled to fit if used with activeIcon, and cropped at the bottom
         otherwise.

        title of the tab is still tinted.
