name: Titanium.UI.3DMatrix
summary:  The 3D Matrix is an object for holding values for a 3D affine transform.
description: |
    The 3DMatrix is created by <Titanium.UI.create3DMatrix>. A 3D transform is
    used to rotate, scale, translate, or skew the objects in three-dimensional
    space. A 3D transform  is represented by a 4 by 4 matrix.

    You create an `identity matrix` by creating a 3D Matrix with an empty
    constructor.

methods:
  - name: invert
    summary: Returns a matrix constructed by inverting this matrix.
    returns:
        type: Titanium.UI.3DMatrix

  - name: multiply
    summary: Returns a matrix constructed by combining two existing matrix.
    description: |
        The result of this function is the first matrix multiplied by the second matrix. You might perform
        several multiplications in order to create a single matrix that contains the cumulative effects of
        several transformations. Note that matrix operations are not commutative - the order in which
        you concatenate matrices is important. That is, the result of multiplying matrix t1 by matrix t2
        does not necessarily equal the result of multiplying matrix t2 by matrix t1.
    returns:
        type: Titanium.UI.3DMatrix
    parameters:
      - name: t2
        summary: Matrix to concatenate to this matrix.
        type: Titanium.UI.3DMatrix

  - name: rotate
    summary: Returns a matrix constructed by rotating this matrix.

        summary: The angle, in degrees, by which to rotate the matrix. A positive value specifies counterclockwise rotation and a negative value specifies clockwise rotation.
        type: Number
      - name: x
        summary: The x part of the vector about which to rotate.
        type: Number
      - name: y
        summary: The y part of the vector about which to rotate.
        type: Number
      - name: z
        summary: The z part of the vector about which to rotate.
        type: Number

  - name: scale

        summary: The value by which to scale y values of the matrix.
        type: Number
      - name: sz
        summary: The value by which to scale z values of the matrix.

examples:
  - title: Apply a 3D Matrix to a Label
    example: |
        Move a label through a translation that repositions it from 100px to 200px from the top of
        the display.

        ``` js
        var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
          backgroundColor: 'white'
        });

        var label = Ti.UI.createLabel({
          font:{fontSize:50},
          text:'Titanium',
          textAlign:'center',
          top: 100
        });
        win.add(label);

        var button = Ti.UI.createButton({
          title:'Animate',
          bottom:20,
          width:200, height:40
        });
        win.add(button);

        button.addEventListener('click', function(){
          var t1 = Ti.UI.create3DMatrix();
          t1 = t1.translate(0, 100, 200);
          t1.m34 = 1.0/-90;
          var a1 = Ti.UI.createAnimation();
          a1.transform = t1;
          a1.duration = 800;
          label.animate(a1);
        });
        win.open();
        ```
