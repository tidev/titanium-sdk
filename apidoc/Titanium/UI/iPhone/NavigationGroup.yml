    A Navigation Group is very similar to Tab Bars with the exception that they do not 
    maintain a group of windows with a interface bar at the bottom.

    The `window` property must be set initially in the constructor when creating a 
    navigation group to the root level window.  All Navigation Groups must have at 
    least one root window that cannot be removed.

    example: |
        In this example, we open 2 windows in a navigation group.  When you run this, the initial window 
        should be blue.  When you click the back button, you should see a window that should be red.
        
            var win = Titanium.UI.createWindow();
            var win1 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
            	backgroundColor:"red",
            	title:"Red Window"
            });
            var nav = Titanium.UI.iPhone.createNavigationGroup({
               window: win1
            });
            win.add(nav);
            win.open();
            var win2 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
