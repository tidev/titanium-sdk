    summary: Fired when the back button is pressed by the user.
    description: |
        This event is fired when the current window's activity detects
        a back button press by the user to navigate back.

        By default this event would trigger the current activity to be finished
        and removed from the task stack. Subscribing to this event with a listener
        will prevent the default behavior. To finish the activity from your listener
        just call the *close* method of the window.

        This event replaces the android:back event. Some behavior
        changes way exist such as the event no longer firing when the
        user dismisses the keyboard with the back button.

  - name: modal
    summary: Boolean to indicate if the window should be opened modal in front of other windows.
    description: |
        Android note: the combination of `fullscreen:true` and `modal:true` will not work as
        expected.  Android modal windows are translucent, and, in Android, the contents of
        a translucent window cannot appear above the status bar.  I.e., even though
        you set `fullscreen:true`, the status bar will still be visible *if* it was visible
        in the previous window.  `navBarHidden` and `modal` do work fine together, however.

        On Android, setting this property forces the creation of a heavyweight window. See "Android
        Heavyweight and Lightweight Windows" in the main description of this class for more
        information.
        
        iOS note: modal windows should not support orientation modes that the
        window they are opened over do not support. Doing otherwise *may* cause
        bad visual/redraw behavior after the modal is dismissed, due to how
        iOS manages modal transitions.
        
        Mobile Web note: On Mobile Web, windows are always modal, blocking input to underlying 
        windows. If the window does not occupy the full screen, setting `modal` to `true` provides 
        a visual cue by dimming any background windows. If the window occupies the full screen, 
        `modal` has no effect.

        On Mobile Web and iOS, the modal property has no effect on whether the window is 
        translucent or opaque.
    type: Boolean
    default: false

  - name: navBarHidden
    summary: For modal windows, hide the nav bar (`true`) or show the nav bar (`false`).

  - name: opacity
    summary: The opacity from 0.0-1.0.
    description: |
        iOS Notes: For modal windows that cover the previous window, the previous window is 
        removed from the render stack after the modal window finishes opening. If the 
        modal window is semi-transparent, the underlying window will be visible during the 
        transition animation, but disappear as soon as the animation is completed. (In general 
        all modal windows cover the previous window, except for iPad modal windows using the 
        Page sheet or Form sheet style.)

        Android Notes: If you set any of `windowSoftInputMode`, `fullscreen`, or `navBarHidden`,
        *and* you wish to use the `opacity` property at any time during the window's lifetime,
        be sure to set an `opacity` value **before** opening the window.  You can later change that
        value -- and you can set it to 1 for full opacity if you wish -- but the important thing
        is that you set it to a value before opening the window if you will want to set it at
        any time during the window's lifetime.

        The technical reason for this is that if the opacity property is present (i.e., has
        been set to something) and a new Android Activity is created for the window,
        then a translucent theme will be used for the Activity.  Window transparency (opacity
        values below 1) will only work in Android if the Activity's theme is translucent, and
        Titanium only uses a translucent theme for an Activity if you set an opacity property
        before opening the window.  Additionally, do not use `opacity` and `fullscreen: true`
        together, because translucent themes in Android cannot hide the status bar.  Finally,
        if you do set the `opacity` property, be sure to also set a `backgroundImage` or
        `backgroundColor` property as well, unless you want the window to be completely
        transparent.

  - name: orientationModes
    summary: |
        Array of supported orientation modes, specified using the orientation
        constants defined in <Titanium.UI>.
    description: |
        To restrict this window to a certain set of orientations, specify one or more
        of the orientation constants [LANDSCAPE_LEFT](Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_LEFT),
        [LANDSCAPE_RIGHT](Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_RIGHT), [PORTRAIT](Titanium.UI.PORTRAIT),
        [UPSIDE_PORTRAIT](Titanium.UI.UPSIDE_PORTRAIT).

        `orientationModes` must be set **before** opening the window.

        To determine the current orientation of the *window*, see
        [Window.orientation](Titanium.UI.Window.orientation).
        To determine the current orientation of the *device*, see
        [Gesture.orientation](Titanium.Gesture.orientation). 
        To be notified when the device's current orientation changes, add a listener for the 
        <Titanium.Gesture.orientationchange> event.

        #### Android Orientation Modes

        On Android, `orientationModes` only takes effect when specified on a heavyweight
        window.

        On Android, orientation behavior is dependent on the Android SDK level
        of the device itself. Devices running Android 2.3 and above support "sensor portait
        mode" and "sensor landscape mode," in these modes, the device is locked into
        either a portrait or landscape orientation, but can switch between the normal and reverse
        orientations (for example, between PORTRAIT and UPSIDE_PORTRAIT).

        In addition, the definition of portrait or
        landscape mode can vary based on the physical design of the device. For example,
        on some devices <Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_LEFT> represents the top of the device being at
        the 270 degree position but other devices may (based on camera position for example)
        treat this position as <Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_RIGHT>. In general, applications for
        Android that need to be aware of orientation should try and limit their orientation
        logic to handling either portrait or landscape rather than worrying about the reverse
        modes. This approach will allow the orientation modes to adopt a more natural feel for
        the specific device.

        The following list breaks down the orientation behavior on Android based on the contents
        of the `orientationModes` array:

        1.  Empty array. Enables orientation to be fully controlled by the device sensor.

        2.  Array includes one or both portrait modes **and** one or both landscape modes.
            Enables full sensor control (identical to an empty array).

        3.  Array contains PORTRAIT **and** UPSIDE_PORTRAIT. On Android 2.3 and above,
            enables sensor portrait mode. This means the screen will shift between
            both portrait modes according to the sensor inside the device.

            On Android versions below 2.3, locks screen orientation in normal portrait mode.

        4.  Array contains LANDSCAPE_LEFT **and** LANDSCAPE_RIGHT. On Android 2.3 and above,
            enables sensor landscape mode. This means the screen will shift between both
            landscape modes according to the sensor inside the device.

            On Android versions below 2.3, locks screen orientation in normal landscape mode.

        5.  Array contains **only** [PORTRAIT](Titanium.UI.PORTRAIT). Locks screen orientation
            to normal portrait mode.

        6.  Array contains **only** [LANDSCAPE_LEFT](Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_LEFT). Locks screen
            orientation to normal landscape mode.

        7.  Array contains **only** [UPSIDE_PORTRAIT](Titanium.UI.UPSIDE_PORTRAIT). On
            Android 2.3 and above, locks screen in reverse portrait mode. 

            On Android versions below 2.3, results are undefined.

        8.  Array contains **only**  [LANDSCAPE_RIGHT](Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_RIGHT). On
            Android 2.3 and above, locks screen in reverse landscape mode. 

            On Android versions below 2.3, results are undefined.

    description: |
        In order for this property to take effect on an emulator, its Android Virtual Device (AVD) 
        must be configured with the `Keyboard Support` setting set to `No`. Note that it is always 
        recommended to test an application on a physical device to understand its true behavior.

        Setting this property forces the creation of a heavyweight window. See "Android Heavyweight
        and Lightweight Windows" in the main description of this class for more information.
        
        This property is capable of representing two settings from the following two groups of 
        settings using the [bitwise OR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR) operation. 
        
        One of the group of soft input *visibility* constants, 
        [SOFT_INPUT_STATE_ALWAYS_HIDDEN](Titanium.UI.Android.SOFT_INPUT_STATE_ALWAYS_HIDDEN), 
        [SOFT_INPUT_STATE_ALWAYS_VISIBLE](Titanium.UI.Android.SOFT_INPUT_STATE_ALWAYS_VISIBLE), 
        [SOFT_INPUT_STATE_HIDDEN](Titanium.UI.Android.SOFT_INPUT_STATE_HIDDEN), 
        [SOFT_INPUT_STATE_UNSPECIFIED](Titanium.UI.Android.SOFT_INPUT_STATE_UNSPECIFIED), 
        or [SOFT_INPUT_STATE_VISIBLE](Titanium.UI.Android.SOFT_INPUT_STATE_VISIBLE).
        
        One of the group of soft input *adjustment* constants, 
        [SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_UNSPECIFIED](Titanium.UI.Android.SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_UNSPECIFIED), 
        [SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_RESIZE](Titanium.UI.Android.SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_RESIZE), 
        or [SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_PAN](Titanium.UI.Android.SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_PAN).
        
        Note that in Javascript, bitwise OR is achieved using the single pipe operand. See the 
        example for a demonstration.

    A window is a top-level container which can contain other views. Windows can
    be *opened* and *closed*.  Opening a window causes the window and its child 
    views to be added to the application's render stack, on top of any previously opened 
    windows. Closing a window removes the window and its children from the render stack.

    Windows *contain* other views, but in general they are not *contained* inside
    other views. There are a few specialized top-level views that manage windows,
    including:
    
    * [NavigationGroup](Titanium.UI.iPhone.NavigationGroup)
    * [SplitWindow](Titanium.UI.iPad.SplitWindow)
    * [TabGroup](Titanium.UI.TabGroup). 

    By default, windows occupy the entire screen except for the navigation bar, 
    status bar, and in the case of windows contained in tab groups, the tab bar.
    To take up the entire screen, covering any other UI, specify `fullscreen:true`
    when creating the window.

    Use the <Titanium.UI.createWindow> method to create a window.

    #### Sub-contexts

    Windows can be loaded from another JavaScript file by specifying the property `url`,
    referencing a file relative to your application `Resources` folder.  It's important
    to note that Titanium will refuse to load JavaScript files from a remote URL. Loading
    remote JavaScript from a URL and providing it with the full capabilities of the Titanium
    API would be very dangerous.

    When your Window is loaded from a separate JavaScript file, the code will be executed in
    a separate JavaScript context (called a "sub-context") than your `app.js` global context.
    It will also execute in its own separate thread.

    On Android, a new context is also created when you create a heavyweight window. See the
    section, "Android Heavyweight and Lightweight Windows," for more information.

    The special property <Titanium.UI.currentWindow> is available inside a sub-context that
    points to the JavaScript instance by reference in the global context.


    #### Passing Data Between Contexts

    By default, sub-context variables cannot access JavaScript references in the global context.
    There are two ways to pass data between the global context and the sub-context:

    - Shared references
    - Events

    **Note that in both cases, you cannot pass functions between contexts, only serializable data.**
    *Serializable data* includes any JavaScript primitive or simple object composed
    of JavaScript primitives.

    ##### Passing Data with Shared References

    You can allow a sub-context access to
    properties in the global context by reference assignment.  An example best illustrates
    how to do this.

    In `app.js`, you could define a property:

        var message = "Hi world!";

    Now, you can create a new Window - let's call it `foo.js` - in your `app.js`.

        var w = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
          url:'foo.js'
        });

    To _give_ your new window access to `message`, you would need to assign it to a
    property on the new window reference, `w`.

        w.myAlertMessage = message;

    This creates a new `myAlertMessage` property on the new window that holds a reference to the
    `message` property in the global context.  Now, let's look at the code for `foo.js`.

        alert(Titanium.UI.currentWindow.myAlertMessage);

    In the above code, the `foo.js` will show an alert containing the text from the `message`
    property in the global context.

    **Note:** You should use caution when adding a custom property to a Titanium object.
    Your property might overwrite an existing property or conflict with a future Titanium 
    property.  If you do this, try to choose a property name unlikely to be used by the Titanium SDK
    in the future. 

    ##### Passing Data with Events

    If you'd like to send events to a window from the global context and vice versa, you could
    use the built-in event mechanism.  For example, you could define a custom event called `foo`.
    The window could listen for this event and then respond with some action. For example, in
    your sub-context you might define:

        Titanium.UI.currentWindow.addEventListener('foo',function(e)
        {
          Titanium.API.info("foo event received = "+JSON.stringify(e));
        });

    You could now fire the event from `app.js` like this:

        var window = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
          url:'bar.js'
        });
        window.open();
        window.fireEvent('foo',{a:'b'});

    It's worth noting two important limitations of the example above:

    * You must open the window before you can send events to it. You also may have to fire
      the event after a specified amount of time if you intend to immediately send data to
      the window. This is because windows are opened asynchronously and on a separate thread
      than the caller thread.

    * You can only send JSON-serializable data in `fireEvent`. If you attempt to send objects
      that have function references, they will be null.


    #### Animations

    Windows can be animated like any normal [View](Titanium.UI.View).  To transition between
    2 windows, you can use the `transition` property on an animation.  For example, to flip
    right-to-left between two windows, you could do the following:

        var window2 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({url:'foo.js'});
        var t = Ti.UI.iPhone.AnimationStyle.FLIP_FROM_LEFT;
        window1.animate({view:window2,transition:t});

    In the above example, the `window2` view will be animated from the right-to-left over `window1`.

    Windows can be opened or closed with animation.  In the example below, we create a window
    that will open from small to large with a bounce effect.  This is done by applying a
    transformation at initialization time that scales the original size of the window to 0.
    When the window is opened, a new 2D transformation is applied that will scale the window
    size from 0 to 110% of it's original size and then, after 1/20th of a second, will scale it
    back to it's original size at 100%. This gives the bounce effect during animation.

        var t = Titanium.UI.create2DMatrix().scale(0);

        // create a window with the initial transform scaled to 0
        var w = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
          backgroundColor:'#336699',
          borderWidth:8,
          borderColor:'#999',
          height:400,
          width:300,
          borderRadius:10,
          opacity:0.92,
          transform:t
        });

        // create first transform to go beyond normal size
        var t1 = Titanium.UI.create2DMatrix().scale(1.1);

        var a = Titanium.UI.createAnimation();
        a.transform = t1;
        a.duration = 200;

        // when this animation completes, scale to normal size
        a.addEventListener('complete', function()
        {
            // we can use the identity transform to take it back to it's real size
          var t2 = Titanium.UI.create2DMatrix();
          w.animate({transform:t2, duration:200});
        });

    #### iPad Modal Windows

    For iPad, iPhone SDK 3.2 and Titanium 1.2 introduced several new ways of presenting
    modal windows. In addition to full-screen modal windows, the iPad supports "Page sheet"
    and "Form sheet" style windows:

    * **Page sheet** style windows have a fixed width, equal to the width of the screen 
      in portait mode, and a height equal to the *current* height of the screen. This means
      that in portrait mode, the window covers the entire screen. In landscape mode, 
      the window is centered on the screen horizontally.

    * **Form sheet** style windows are smaller than the screen size, and centered on the screen.

    The example below is a modal window using the Form sheet style:

    ![modal](http://img.skitch.com/20100406-bqb3f8pb6e4ger7wkcdcw5mbar.png)

    You can create this type of modal window on iPad with the following code snippet:

        var window = Titanium.UI.createWindow();
        window.open({
          modal:true,
          modalTransitionStyle: Ti.UI.iPhone.MODAL_TRANSITION_STYLE_FLIP_HORIZONTAL,
          modalStyle: Ti.UI.iPhone.MODAL_PRESENTATION_FORMSHEET
        })

    #### Android Heavyweight and Lightweight Windows

    In Android, Titanium windows can be heavyweight or lightweight:

    - A *heavyweight* window is associated with a new Android 
      [Activity](Titanium.Android.Activity). Creating a heavyweight window always 
      creates a new JavaScript context.

    - A *lightweight* window is a fullscreen view, and runs in the same Android Activity 
      as the code that created it. Creating a lightweight window creates a new 
      JavaScript context if it was created with the 'url' property set.

    The [createWindow](Titanium.UI.createWindow) call creates a heavyweight window 
    if any of the following properties are defined (set to either `true` or `false`)
    on creation:

    * `fullscreen`
    * `navBarHidden`
    * `modal`
    * `windowSoftInputMode`

    A heavyweight window is always created when you open a new window from inside a 
    [TabGroup](Titanium.UI.TabGroup).

    #### Android "root" Windows

    In Android, you may wish to specify that a window which you create (such as the first
    window) should be considered the root window and that the application should exit when
    the back button is pressed from that window.  This is particularly useful if your application
    is not using a Tab Group and therefore the splash screen window is appearing whenever you
    press the back button from your lowest window on the stack.

    To indicate that a particular window should cause an application to exit when the back
    button is pressed, pass `exitOnClose: true` as one of the creation arguments, as shown here:

        var win = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
          title: 'My Root Window',
          exitOnClose: true
        });
