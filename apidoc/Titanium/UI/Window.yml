    summary: Boolean to indicate if the window should be opened modal in front of other windows.
    description: |
        Android note: the combination of `fullscreen:true` and `modal:true` will not work as
        expected.  Android modal windows are translucent, and, in Android, the contents of
        a translucent window cannot appear above the status bar.  I.e., even though
        you set `fullscreen:true`, the status bar will still be visible *if* it was visible
        in the previous window.  `navBarHidden` and `modal` do work fine together, however.
    platforms: [android, iphone, ipad]
    type: Boolean
    default: false

  - name: navBarHidden
    summary: For modal windows, hide the nav bar (`true`) or show the nav bar (`false`).

  - name: opacity
    summary: The opacity from 0.0-1.0.
    description: |
        Android Notes: If you set any of `windowSoftInputMode`, `fullscreen`, or `navBarHidden`,
        *and* you wish to use the `opacity` property at any time during the window's lifetime,
        be sure to set an `opacity` value before opening the window.  You can later change that
        value -- and you can set it to 1 for full opacity if you wish -- but the important thing
        is that you set it to a value before opening the window if you will want to set it at
        any time during the window's lifetime.

        The technical reason for this is that if the opacity property is present (i.e., has
        been set to something) and a new Android Activity is created for the window,
        then a translucent theme will be used for the Activity.  Window transparency (opacity
        values below 1) will only work in Android if the Activity's theme is translucent, and
        Titanium only uses a translucent theme for an Activity if you set an opacity property
        before opening the window.  Additionally, do not use `opacity` and `fullscreen: true`
        together, because translucent themes in Android cannot hide the status bar.  Finally,
        if you do set the `opacity` property, be sure to also set a `backgroundImage` or
        `backgroundColor` property as well, unless you want the window to be completely
        transparent.

  - name: orientationModes
    summary: |
        Array of supported orientation modes, specified using the orientation
        constants defined in <Titanium.UI>.
    description: |
        To restrict this window to a certain set of orientations, specify one or more
        of the orientation constants [LANDSCAPE_LEFT](Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_LEFT),
        [LANDSCAPE_RIGHT](Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_RIGHT), [PORTAIT](Titanium.UI.PORTAIT),
        [UPSIDE_PORTRAIT](Titanium.UI.UPSIDE_PORTRAIT).

        `orientationModes` must be set **before** opening the window.

        On Android, the orientation modes that can be set are dependent on the Android SDK level
        of the device itself.  It should be noted that, the definition of portrait or
        landscape mode can vary based on the physical orientation of the device.  For example,
        on some devices <Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_LEFT> represents the top of the device being at
        the 270 degree position but other devices may (based on camera position for example)
        treat this position as <Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_RIGHT>.  In general, applications for
        Android that need to be aware of orientation should try and limit their orientation
        logic to handling either portrait or landscape rather than worrying about the reverse
        modes. This approach will allow the orientation modes to adopt a more natural feel for
        the specific device.

        The following list breaks down the orientation behavior on Android:

        1) (<Titanium.UI.PORTRAIT> OR <Titanium.UI.UPSIDE_PORTRAIT>) AND
           (<Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_LEFT> OR <Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_RIGHT>) - Enables full
           sensor which lets the operating system control the orientation of the screen based
           on the sensor inside the device.
        2) <Titanium.UI.PORTRAIT> OR <Titanium.UI.UPSIDE_PORTRAIT> - Enables sensor portrait
           mode on Android 2.3 and above.  Sensor portrait mode on Android means the screen
           will shift between both portrait modes according to the sensor inside the device.
           If the Android version is less than 2.3, then normal portrait mode is locked.
        3) <Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_LEFT> OR <Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_RIGHT> - Enables sensor
           landscape mode on Android 2.3 and above.  Sensor landscape mode on Android means
           the screen will shift between both landscape modes according to the sensor inside
           the device.  If the Android version is less than 2.3, then normal landscape mode
           is locked.
        4) <Titanium.UI.PORTRAIT> - Locks screen orientation to portrait mode.
        5) <Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE> - Locks screen orientation to landscape mode.
        6) empty array - Resets the orientation to default sensor control.

    The Window is created by the method <Titanium.UI.createWindow>. Unlike [Views]
    (Titanium.UI.View), Windows can be opened and closed and can have special display
    properties such as `fullscreen` or `modal`.

    <a id="contexts"/>
    #### Sub-contexts

    Windows can be loaded from another JavaScript file by specifying the property `url`,
    referencing a file relative to your application `Resources` folder.  It's important
    to note that Titanium will refuse to load JavaScript files from a remote URL. Loading
    remote JavaScript from a URL and providing it with the full capabilities of the Titanium
    API would be very dangerous.

    When your Window is loaded from a separate JavaScript file, the code will be executed in
    a separate JavaScript context (called a "sub-context") than your `app.js` global context.
    It will also execute in its own separate thread.

    On Android, a new context is also created when you create a heavyweight window. See the
    section, "Android Heavyweight and Lightweight Windows" for more information.

    The special property <Titanium.UI.currentWindow> is available inside a sub-context that
    points to the JavaScript instance by reference in the global context.


    <a id="passingdata"/>
    #### Passing Data Between Contexts

    By default, sub-context variables cannot access JavaScript references in the global context.
    There are two ways to pass data between the global context and the sub-context:

    - Shared references
    - Events

    **Note that in both cases, you cannot pass functions between contexts, only serializable data.**
    *Serializable data* includes any JavaScript primitive or simple object composed
    of JavaScript primitives.

    ##### Passing Data with Shared References

    You can allow a sub-context access to
    properties in the global context by reference assignment.  An example best illustrates
    how to do this.

    In `app.js`, you could define a property:

        var message = "Hi world!";

    Now, you can create a new Window - let's call it `foo.js` - in your `app.js`.

        var w = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
        	url:'foo.js'
        });

    To _give_ your new window access to `message`, you would need to assign it to a
    property on the new window reference, `w`.

        w.alertMessage = message;

    This creates a new `alertMessage` property on the new window that holds a reference to the
    `message` property in the global context.  Now, let's look at the code for `foo.js`.

        alert(Titanium.UI.currentWindow.alertMessage);

    In the above code, the `foo.js` will show an alert containing the text from the `message`
    property in the global context.

    ##### Passing Data with Events

    If you'd like to send events to a window from the global context and vice versa, you could
    use the built-in event mechanism.  For example, you could define a custom event called `foo`.
    The window could listen for this event and then respond with some action. For example, in
    your sub-context you might define:

        Titanium.UI.currentWindow.addEventListener('foo',function(e)
        {
        	Titanium.API.info("foo event received = "+JSON.stringify(e));
        });

    You could now fire the event from `app.js` like this:

        var window = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
        	url:'bar.js'
        });
        window.open();
        window.fireEvent('foo',{a:'b'});

    It's worth noting two important limitations of the example above:

    * You must open the window before you can send events to it. You also may have to fire
      the event after a specified amount of time if you intend to immediately send data to
      the window. This is because windows are opened asynchronously and on a separate thread
      than the caller thread.

    * You can only send JSON-serializable data in `fireEvent`. If you attempt to send objects
      that have function references, they will be null.


    #### Animations

    Windows can be animated like any normal [View](Titanium.UI.View).  To transition between
    2 windows, you can use the `transition` property on an animation.  For example, to flip
    right-to-left between two windows, you could do the following:

        var window2 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({url:'foo.js'});
        var t = Ti.UI.iPhone.AnimationStyle.FLIP_FROM_LEFT;
        window1.animate({view:window2,transition:t});

    In the above example, the `window2` view will be animated from the right-to-left over `window1`.

    Windows can be opened or closed with animation.  In the example below, we create a window
    that will open from small to large with a bounce effect.  This is done by applying a
    transformation at initialization time that scales the original size of the window to 0.
    When the window is opened, a new 2D transformation is applied that will scale the window
    size from 0 to 110% of it's original size and then, after 1/20th of a second, will scale it
    back to it's original size at 100%. This gives the bounce effect during animation.

        var t = Titanium.UI.create2DMatrix().scale(0);

        // create a window with the initial transform scaled to 0
        var w = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
        	backgroundColor:'#336699',
        	borderWidth:8,
        	borderColor:'#999',
        	height:400,
        	width:300,
        	borderRadius:10,
        	opacity:0.92,
        	transform:t
        });

        // create first transform to go beyond normal size
        var t1 = Titanium.UI.create2DMatrix().scale(1.1);

        var a = Titanium.UI.createAnimation();
        a.transform = t1;
        a.duration = 200;

        // when this animation completes, scale to normal size
        a.addEventListener('complete', function()
        {
            // we can use the identity transform to take it back to it's real size
        	var t2 = Titanium.UI.create2DMatrix();
        	w.animate({transform:t2, duration:200});
        });

    #### iPad Modal Windows

    For iPad, iPhone SDK 3.2 and Titanium 1.2 introduced several new ways of presenting
    modal windows. In addition to full-screen modal windows, the iPad supports "Page sheet"
    and "Form sheet" style windows:

    * **Page sheet** style windows have a fixed width, equal to the width of the screen 
      in portait mode, and a height equal to the *current* height of the screen. This means
      that in portrait mode, the window covers the entire screen. In landscape mode, 
      the window is centered on the screen horizontally.

    * **Form sheet** style windows are smaller than the screen size, and centered on the screen.

    The example below is a modal window using the Form sheet style:

    ![modal](http://img.skitch.com/20100406-bqb3f8pb6e4ger7wkcdcw5mbar.png)

    You can create this type of modal window on iPad with the following code snippet:

        var window = Titanium.UI.createWindow();
        window.open({
        	modal:true,
        	modalTransitionStyle: Ti.UI.iPhone.MODAL_TRANSITION_STYLE_FLIP_HORIZONTAL,
        	modalStyle: Ti.UI.iPhone.MODAL_PRESENTATION_FORMSHEET
        })

    #### Android Heavyweight and Lightweight Windows

    In Android, Titanium windows can be heavyweight or lightweight:

    - A *heavyweight* window is associated with a new Android [Activity]
      (Titanium.Android.Activity). Creating a heavyweight window always 
      creates a new JavaScript context.

    - A *lightweight* window is a fullscreen view, and runs in the same Android Activity 
      as the code that created it. Creating a lightweight window creates a new 
      JavaScript context if it was created with the 'url' property set.

    The [createWindow](Titanium.UI.createWindow) call creates a heavyweight window 
    if any of the following properties are true on creation:

    * `fullscreen`
    * `navBarHidden`
    * `modal`
    * `windowSoftInputMode`

    A heavyweight window is always created when you open a new window from inside a [TabGroup]
    (Titanium.UI.TabGroup).

    #### Android "root" Windows

    In Android, you may wish to specify that a window which you create (such as the first
    window) should be considered the root window and that the application should exit when
    the back button is pressed from that window.  This is particularly useful if your application
    is not using a Tab Group and therefore the splash screen window is appearing whenever you
    press the back button from your lowest window on the stack.

    To indicate that a particular window should cause an application to exit when the back
    button is pressed, pass `exitOnClose: true` as one of the creation arguments, as shown here:

        var win = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
        	title: 'My Root Window',
        	exitOnClose: true
        });


examples:
  - title: Full Screen Window example
    example: |
        Create a fullscreen window with a red background.

            var window = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
               backgroundColor:'red'
            });
            window.open({fullscreen:true});
