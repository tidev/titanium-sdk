        combination of `fullscreen:true` and `modal:true` will not work as expected.  Android modal windows are translucent,
        and, in Android, the contents of a translucent window cannot appear above the status bar.  I.e., even though
        you say `fullscreen:true`, the status bar will still be visible *if* it was visible in the previous window.  `navBarHidden` and
        `modal` do work fine together, however.

    description: |
        The opacity from 0.0-1.0.  Android Notes: If you set any of `windowSoftInputMode`, `fullscreen`, or `navBarHidden`, *and* you wish to use the `opacity` property at any time during the window's lifetime, be sure to set an `opacity` value before opening the window.  You can later change that value -- and you can set it to 1 for full opacity if you wish -- but the important thing is that you set it to a value before opening the window if you will want to set it at any time during the window's lifetime.  The technical reason for this is that if the opacity property is present (i.e., has been set to something) and a new Android Activity will be created for the window, then a translucent theme will be used for the Activity.  Window transparency (opacity values below 1) will only work in Android if the Activity's theme is translucent, and we will only use a translucent theme for an Activity if you set an opacity property before opening the window.  Additionally, do not use `opacity` and `fullscreen: true` together, because translucent themes in Android cannot hide the status bar.  Finally, if you do set the `opacity` property, be sure to also set a `backgroundImage` or `backgroundColor` property as well, unless you want the window to be completely transparent.

  - name: orientationModes
    description: |
        Array of orientation mode constants defined in <Titanium.UI>.  On Android, orientation modes that can be set are dependant on the Android SDK level of the device itself.  It should be noted that, the definition of portrait or 
        landscape mode can vary based on the physical orientation of the device.  For example, on some devices <Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_LEFT> represents the top of the device being at the 270 degree position but other devices 
        may (based on camera position for example) treat this position as <Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_RIGHT>.  In general, applications for Android that need to be aware of orientation should try and limit their orientation logic to handling 
        either portrait or landscape rather than worrying about the reverse modes.  This approach will allow the orientation modes to adopt a more natural feel for the specific device.
        
        The following list breaks down the orientation behavior on Android:
        1) (<Titanium.UI.PORTRAIT> OR <Titanium.UI.UPSIDE_PORTRAIT>) AND (<Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_LEFT> OR <Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_RIGHT>) - Enables full sensor which lets the operating system control the orientation of the screen based on the sensor inside the device.
        2) <Titanium.UI.PORTRAIT> OR <Titanium.UI.UPSIDE_PORTRAIT> - Enables sensor portrait mode on Android 2.3 and above.  Sensor portrait mode on Android means the screen will shift between both portrait modes according to the sensor inside the device.  If the Android version is less than 2.3, then normal portrait mode is locked.
        3) <Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_LEFT> OR <Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_RIGHT> - Enables sensor landscape mode on Android 2.3 and above.  Sensor landscape mode on Android means the screen will shift between both landscape modes according to the sensor inside the device.  If the Android version is less than 2.3, then normal landscape mode is locked.
        4) <Titanium.UI.PORTRAIT> - Locks screen orientation to portrait mode
        5) <Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE> - Locks screen orientation to landscape mode
        6) empty array - resets the orientation to default sensor control

notes: |
    ### Sub-contexts
    
    Windows can be loaded from another Javascript file by specifying the property `url` and reference a file relative to your application `Resources` folder.  It's important to note that Titanium will refuse to load Javascript files from a remote URL. Loading remote Javascript from a URL and providing it with the full capabilities of the Titanium API would be very dangerous. 
    
    When you Window is loaded from a separate Javascript file, the code will be executed in a separate Javascript context (called a "sub-context") than your `app.js` global context.  It will also execute in its own separate thread.  
    
    The special property <Titanium.UI.currentWindow> is available inside a sub-context that points to the Javascript instance by reference in the global context.  
    
    
    ### Passing Data
    
    By default, sub-context variables cannot access Javascript references in the global context.  However, the global context can allow its sub-contexts the ability to have access to properties and functions in the global context by reference assignment.  An example best illustrates how to do this.
    
    In `app.js`, you could define a function and a property.
    
        var a = 1;
        function b()
        {
        	return "hello";
        }
    
    Now, you can create a new Window - let's call it `foo.js` - in your `app.js`.
    
        var w = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
        	url:'foo.js'
        });
    
    To _give_ your new window access to both `a` and `b`, you would need to assign them to the 
    new window reference `w`.
    
        w.a = a;
        w.b = b;
    
    Of course, you could give them a different name than their original names.  However, what name you give them in your `app.js` is how you will reference them in `foo.js`.  Now, let's look at the code for `foo.js`.
    
        alert("b() = "+Titanium.UI.currentWindow.b());
    
    In the above code, the `foo.js` will execute the function `b` in the global context and return the result.  Since `b` is a reference (vs. a copy by value), any changes made to these Javascript references will be immediately available in all sub-contexts.
    
    ### Events
    
    If you'd like to send events to a window from the global context and vice versa, you could use the built-in event mechanism.  For example, you could define a custom event called `foo`. The window could listen for this event and then respond with some action.  For example, in your sub-context you might define:
    
        Titanium.UI.currentWindow.addEventListener('foo',function(e)
        {
        	Titanium.API.info("foo event received = "+JSON.stringify(e));
        });
    
    You could now fire the event from `app.js` like this:
    
        var window = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
        	url:'bar.js'
        });
        window.open();
        window.fireEvent('foo',{a:'b'});
    
    It's worth noting two important limitations of the example above:
    
    * You must open the window before you can send events to it. You also may have to fire the event after a specified amount of time if you intend to immediately send data to the window.  This is because windows are opened asynchronously and on a separate thread than the caller thread.
    * You can only send JSON-serializable data in a fireEvent.  If you attempt to send objects that have function references, they will be null.
    
    
    ### Animations
    
    Windows can be animated like any normal [View](Titanium.UI.View).  To transition between 2 windows, you can use the `transition` property on an animation.  For example, to flip right-to-left between two windows, you could do the following:
    
        var window2 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({url:'foo.js'});
        var t = Ti.UI.iPhone.AnimationStyle.FLIP_FROM_LEFT;
        window1.animate({view:window2,transition:t});
    
    In the above example, the `window2` view will be animated from the right-to-left over `window1`.
    
    Windows can be opened or closed with animation.  In the example below, we create a window that will open from small to large with a bounce effect.  This is done by applying a transformation at initialization time that scales the original size of the window to 0.  When the window is opened, a new 2D transformation is applied that will scale the window size from 0 to 110% of it's original size and then, after 1/20th of a second, will scale it back to it's original size at 100%. This gives the bounce effect during animation. 
    
        var t = Titanium.UI.create2DMatrix().scale(0);
        
        // create a window with the initial transform scaled to 0
        var w = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
        	backgroundColor:'#336699',
        	borderWidth:8,
        	borderColor:'#999',
        	height:400,
        	width:300,
        	borderRadius:10,
        	opacity:0.92,
        	transform:t
        });
        
        // create first transform to go beyond normal size
        var t1 = Titanium.UI.create2DMatrix().scale(1.1);
        
        var a = Titanium.UI.createAnimation();
        a.transform = t1;
        a.duration = 200;
        
        // when this animation completes, scale to normal size
        a.addEventListener('complete', function()
        {
            // we can use the identity transform to take it back to it's real size
        	var t2 = Titanium.UI.create2DMatrix();
        	w.animate({transform:t2, duration:200});
        });
    
    ### iPad Modal Windows
    
    For iPad, iPhone SDK 3.2 and Titanium 1.2 introduced several new ways of presenting modal windows.  
    
    The example below is a modal window.
    
    ![modal](http://img.skitch.com/20100406-bqb3f8pb6e4ger7wkcdcw5mbar.png)
    
    You can create this type of modal window on iPad with the following code snippet:
    
        var window = Titanium.UI.createWindow();
        window.open({
        	modal:true,
        	modalTransitionStyle: Ti.UI.iPhone.MODAL_TRANSITION_STYLE_FLIP_HORIZONTAL,
        	modalStyle: Ti.UI.iPhone.MODAL_PRESENTATION_FORMSHEET
        })
    
    ### Android "root" Windows
    
    In Android, you may wish to specify that a window which you create (such as the first window) should be considered the root window and that the application should exit when the back button is pressed from that window.  This is particularly useful if your application is not using a Tab Group and therefore the splash screen window is appearing whenever you press the back button from your lowest window on the stack.
    
    To indicate that a particular window should cause an application to exit when the back button is pressed, pass `exitOnClose: true` as one of the creation arguments, as shown here:
    
        var win = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
        	title: 'My Root Window',
        	exitOnClose: true
        });


examples:
  - title: Full Screen Window example
    example: |
        Create a fullscreen window with a red background.
        
            var window = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
               backgroundColor:'red'
            });
            window.open({fullscreen:true});
