name: Titanium.UI.Window
summary: The Window is an empty drawing surface or container.
description: |
    To create a window, use the <Titanium.UI.createWindow> method or a **`<Window>`** Alloy element.

    A window is a top-level container which can contain other views. Windows can
    be *opened* and *closed*.  Opening a window causes the window and its child
    views to be added to the application's render stack, on top of any previously opened
    windows. Closing a window removes the window and its children from the render stack.

    Windows *contain* other views, but in general they are not *contained* inside
    other views. There are a few specialized views that manage windows:

    * [NavigationWindow](Titanium.UI.NavigationWindow)
    * [SplitWindow](Titanium.UI.iPad.SplitWindow)
    * [TabGroup](Titanium.UI.TabGroup)
    * [Tab](Titanium.UI.Tab)

    By default, windows occupy the entire screen except for the navigation bar,
    status bar, and in the case of windows contained in tab groups, the tab bar.
    To take up the entire screen, covering any other UI, specify `fullscreen:true`
    when creating the window.

    ### Pass Context Between Windows

    To pass data between windows, use a
    [CommonJS module](https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/CommonJS_Modules_in_Titanium)
    to save information from one window then retrieve it in another.  In the example below, the foo
    module exposes two methods to store and retrieve an object.  The first window of the project
    loads the foo module and uses the set method to store some data before opening the second window.
    The second window loads the same module and is able to retrieve the content saved by the first
    window with the get method.

    Note that for Alloy projects, you can simply pass the context as the second argument of the
    Alloy.createController method, then retrieve the data with the special variable `$.args`
    in the controller code.

    `app/lib/foo.js`:
    ``` js
    // For a classic Titanium project, save the file to 'Resources/foo.js'
    var data = {};
    function setData (obj){
        data = obj;
    }
    function getData () {
        return data;
    }

    // The special variable 'exports' exposes the functions as public
    exports.setData = setData;
    exports.getData = getData;
    ```

    `app/views/index.xml`:
    ``` xml
    <Alloy>
        <Window backgroundColor="blue">
            <Label onClick="openWindow">Open the Red Window!</Label>
        </Window>
    </Alloy>
    ```

    `app/controllers/index.js`:
    ``` js
    var foo = require('foo');
    foo.setData({foobar: 42});

    function openWindow () {
        var win2 = Alloy.createController('win2').getView();
        // For Alloy projects, you can pass context
        // to the controller in the Alloy.createController method.
        // var win2 = Alloy.createController('win2', {foobar: 42}).getView();
        win2.open();
    }

    $.index.open();
    ```

    `app/views/win2.xml`:
    ``` xml
    <Alloy>
        <Window backgroundColor="red">
            <Label id="label">I am a red window.</Label>
        </Window>
    </Alloy>
    ```

    `app/controllers/win2.js`:
    ``` js
    var foo = require('foo');
    $.label.text = foo.getData().foobar;

    // For Alloy projects, you can also pass in context
    // with the Alloy.createController method and retrieve
    // it in the controller code.
    // $.label.text = $.args.foobar;
    ```

    ### Modal Windows

    In the user interface, a modal window is a window that blocks the main application UI until the
    modal window is dismissed.  A modal window requires the user to interact with it to resume the
    normal flow of the application.  For example, if an action requires the user to login, the
    application can present a login window, then after the user is authenticated, the normal flow
    of the application can be resumed.

    To create a modal window, set the `modal` property to `true` in the dictionary passed to
    either the `Titanium.UI.createWindow()` method or the Window object's `open()` method.

    #### Android Behavior

    The Android platform does not has the concept of a modal window but instead uses modal
    dialogs. You are probably looking for a <Titanium.UI.AlertDialog> or <Titanium.UI.OptionDialog> and
    the `androidView` property rather than a modal window.

    However, if you know what you are doing and use `modal`, Titanium creates a window with
    a translucent background (if the background properties are not set).

    The combination of `fullscreen:true` and `modal:true` will not work as expected.
    If the background window displays the status bar or action bar, it will be visible behind the modal
    window.

    Note that Titanium will allow a non-modal window to open on top of a modal window on
    Android.

    #### iOS Behavior

    By default, if you do not set a `backgroundColor`, the modal's background color will be the
    value set to `Titanium.UI.backgroundColor`.

    The modal window will not show the background window stack even if you make the modal translucent.
    For fullscreen modals, when the modal appears, the background window stack is removed. For
    non-fullscreen modals on the iPad, the background will be opaque gray if a background color
    is not specified.

    By default, modal windows appear from the bottom of the screen and slide up. To change the default
    transition, set the `modalTransitionStyle` property to a
    `Titanium.UI.iOS.MODAL_TRANSITION_STYLE_*` constant in the dictionary passed to the Window
    object's `open()` method.

    Modal windows should not support orientation modes that the window they are opened over do not
    support. Doing otherwise *may* cause bad visual/redraw behavior after the modal is dismissed,
    due to how iOS manages modal transitions.

    Starting with Release 3.1.3, if the `orientationModes` property of a modal window is undefined,
    then the orientations supported by this window would be the orientation modes specified by
    the `tiapp.xml` with the `UISupportedInterfaceOrientations` key.

    iOS does not allow opening non-modal windows on top of a modal window.

    ##### iPad Features

    In addition to full-screen modal windows, iPad supports "Page sheet"
    and "Form sheet" style windows:

    * **Page sheet** style windows have a fixed width, equal to the width of the screen
      in portait mode, and a height equal to the *current* height of the screen. This means
      that in portrait mode, the window covers the entire screen. In landscape mode,
      the window is centered on the screen horizontally.

    * **Form sheet** style windows are smaller than the screen size, and centered on the screen.

    The example below is a modal window using the Form sheet style:

    <img src="images/window/window-modal.png" width="400" />

    You can create this type of modal window on iPad with the following code snippet:

    ``` js
    var win = Ti.UI.createNavigationWindow({
        window: Ti.UI.createWindow({
            title: "Modal Window"
        })
    });

    win.open({
        modal: true,
        modalTransitionStyle: Ti.UI.iOS.MODAL_TRANSITION_STYLE_FLIP_HORIZONTAL,
        modalStyle: Ti.UI.iOS.MODAL_PRESENTATION_FORMSHEET
    });
    ```

    ### Animations

    Windows can be animated like a [View](Titanium.UI.View), such as using an animation
    to open or close a window.  The example below creates a window
    that opens from small to large with a bounce effect.  This is done by applying a
    transformation at initialization time that scales the original size of the window to 0.
    When the window is opened, a new 2D transformation is applied that will scale the window
    size from 0 to 110% of it's original size, then, after 1/20th of a second, it is scaled
    back to it's original size at 100%. This gives the bounce effect during animation.

    `app/views/index.xml`:
    ``` xml
    <Alloy>
        <Window backgroundColor="blue" onPostlayout="animateOpen" >
            <Label color="orange">Animated Window</Label>
        </Window>
    </Alloy>
    ```

    `app/controllers/index.js`:
    ``` js
    $.index.transform = Titanium.UI.createMatrix2D().scale(0);
    $.index.open();

    var a = Ti.UI.createAnimation({
        transform : Ti.UI.createMatrix2D().scale(1.1),
        duration : 2000,
    });
    a.addEventListener('complete', function() {
        $.index.animate({
            transform: Ti.UI.createMatrix2D(),
            duration: 200
        });
    });

    function animateOpen() {
        $.index.animate(a);
    }
    ```

    Note that to animate an Android window while you open it, you need to follow a specific
    procedure which is explained below in "Window Transitions in Android".

    ### iOS Platform Notes

    #### iOS Transition Animations

    iOS contains built-in transition animations when switching between non-modal windows. In the Window's
    `open` method, set the `transition` property to a `Titanium.UI.iOS.AnimationStyle` constant to use an animation.
    For example, to flip right-to-left between two windows:

    `app/views/index.xml`:
    ``` xml
    <Alloy>
        <Window backgroundColor="blue" onOpen="animateOpen">
            <Label id="label">I am a blue window!</Label>
        </Window>
    </Alloy>
    ```

    `app/controllers/index.js`
    ``` js
    function animateOpen() {
        Alloy.createController('win2').getView().open({
            transition: Ti.UI.iOS.AnimationStyle.FLIP_FROM_LEFT
        });
    }
    $.index.open();
    ```

    `app/views/win2.xml`:
    ``` xml
    <Alloy>
        <Window backgroundColor="red">
            <Label id="label">I am a red window!</Label>
        </Window>
    </Alloy>
    ```

    In the above example, the red window will be animated from the right-to-left over the blue window.

    You can create transition animations when opening and closing windows in
    either a <Titanium.UI.iOS.NavigationWindow> or <Titanium.UI.Tab>.

    Use the <Titanium.UI.iOS.createTransitionAnimation> method to specify an animation objects to hide and
    show the window, then set the newly created TransitionAnimation object to the window's
    <Titanium.UI.Window.transitionAnimation> property.

    In the example below, the windows are closed by rotating them upside down while simulatenously
    making them transparent:

    `app/views/index.xml`:
    ``` xml
    <Alloy>
        <NavigationWindow platform="ios">
            <Window id="redwin" title="Red Window" backgroundColor="red">
                <Button id="button" onClick="openBlueWindow">Open Blue Window</Button>
            </Window>
        </NavigationWindow>
    </Alloy>
    ```

    `app/controllers/index.js`:
    ``` js
    function openBlueWindow(e) {
        var bluewin = Alloy.createController('bluewin').getView();
        $.index.openWindow(bluewin);
    }

    $.redwin.transitionAnimation = Ti.UI.iOS.createTransitionAnimation({
        duration: 300,
        // The show transition makes the window opaque and rotates it correctly
        transitionTo: {
            opacity: 1,
            duration: 300,
            transform: Ti.UI.createMatrix2D()
        },
        // The hide transition makes the window transparent and rotates it upside down
        transitionFrom: {
            opacity: 0,
            duration: 300 / 2,
            transform: Ti.UI.createMatrix2D().rotate(180),
        }
    });

    $.index.open();
    ```

    `app/views/bluewin.xml`:
    ``` xml
    <Alloy>
        <Window title="Blue Window" backgroundColor="blue" opacity="0">
            <Button onClick="closeWindow">Close Window</Button>
        </Window>
    </Alloy>
    ```

    `app/controllers/bluewin.js`:
    ``` js
    function closeWindow(){
        $.bluewin.close();
    }

    $.bluewin.transitionAnimation = Ti.UI.iOS.createTransitionAnimation({
        duration: 300,
        // The show transition makes the window opaque and rotates it correctly
        transitionTo: {
            opacity: 1,
            duration: 300,
            transform: Ti.UI.createMatrix2D()
        },
        // The hide transition makes the window transparent and rotates it upside down
        transitionFrom: {
            opacity: 0,
            duration: 300 / 2,
            transform: Ti.UI.createMatrix2D().rotate(180),
        }
    });

    $.bluewin.transform = Ti.UI.createMatrix2D().rotate(180);
    ```

    ### Android Platform Notes

    #### Window Transitions in Android

    A window is associated with a new Android [Activity](Titanium.Android.Activity). The only way
    to animate the opening or closing of an Activity in Android is to apply an animation _resource_
    to it. Passing a <Titanium.UI.Animation> object as a parameter to <Titanium.UI.Window.open>
    or <Titanium.UI.Window.close> will have no effect.

    Instead, in the parameter dictionary you pass to <Titanium.UI.Window.open> or <Titanium.UI.Window.close>,
    you should set the `activityEnterAnimation` and `activityExitAnimation` keys to
    animation resources. `activityEnterAnimation` should be set to the animation you want to run
    on the incoming activity, while `activityExitAnimation` should be set to the animation you
    want to run on the outgoing activity that you are leaving.

    Animation resources are available through the `R` object. Use either <Titanium.Android.R> for
    built-in resources or <Titanium.App.Android.R> for resources that you package in your application.

    As an example, you may wish for the window that you are opening to fade in while the window
    you are leaving should fade out:

    ``` js
    var win2 = Ti.UI.createWindow();
    win2.open({
        activityEnterAnimation: Ti.Android.R.anim.fade_in,
        activityExitAnimation: Ti.Android.R.anim.fade_out
    });
    ```

    See the official Android [R.anim](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.anim.html) documentation
    for information about built-in animations.

    For information on creating your own animation resource XML files, see
    "[View Animation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/animation-resource.html#View)"
    in Android's Resources documentation. After creating an animation resource file, you can place it under
    `platform/android/res/anim` in your Titanium project folder and it will be packaged in your app's APK
    and then available via <Titanium.App.Android.R>.

    #### Material design transitions in Android

    You can provide transition between common elements among participating activities. For example in a master-detail pattern,
    clicking on a row item animates the common elements of image, title smoothly into details activity as if they are part of
    the same scene. This seamless animation is called shared element transition and can be achieved by the following steps.

    Say window A is opening window B.
    Firstly, specify a unique `transitionName` to the common UI elements between the two windows.
    Next use `addSharedElement` method on window B passing the window A common UI element and the transition name. This tells the system
    which views are shared between windows and performs the transition between them. Note that we specify the UI elements of window A
    since the system needs the source element and connects the destination element from the shared transition name once window B is created
    and shown.

    For example to transition a title label in window A to a title label in window B.

    ``` js
    // Create label in window A with a unique transitionName.
    var titleInWinA = new Ti.UI.createLabel({
        text:'Top 10 pics from Mars!',
        left:70, top: 6,
        width:200, height: 30,
        transitionName: 'title'
    });
    windowA.add(titleInWinA);

    // Creating label in window B, note that the same transitionName is used.
    var titleInWinB = new Ti.UI.createLabel({
        text:'Top 10 pics from Mars!',
        left:50, top: 10,
        width:200, height: 30,
        transitionName: 'title'
    });

    // Before opening window B specify the common UI elements.
    windowB.addSharedElement(titleInWinA, "title");
    windowB.open();
    ```

    Further you can use `activityEnterTransition`, `activityExitTransition`, `activityReenterTransition`
    and `activityReturnTransition` to customize the way activities transition into the scene. These are intended
    to be used with views set up as "shared elements" via the `addSharedElement()` method where these views
    will be moved from window to the other. As of Titanium 8.0.1, you don't have to add views as shared elements
    to use these transition animations, while in older version of Titanium that was required.

    See the official Android [Activity Transitions](https://developer.android.com/training/material/animations.html#Transitions)
    documentation for more information and supported transitons.

    #### Android "root" Windows

    In Android, you may wish to specify that a window which you create (such as the first
    window) should be considered the root window and that the application should exit when
    the back button is pressed from that window.  This is particularly useful if your application
    is not using a Tab Group and therefore the splash screen window is appearing whenever you
    press the back button from your lowest window on the stack.

    To indicate that a particular window should cause an application to exit when the back
    button is pressed, pass `exitOnClose: true` as one of the creation arguments, as shown here:

    ``` js
    var win = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
      title: 'My Root Window',
      exitOnClose: true
    });
    ```

    Starting with Release 3.2.0, the root window's `exitOnClose` property is set to `true` by
    default.  Prior to Release 3.2.0, the default value of the property was `false` for all windows.

    platforms: [android]
    summary: Fired when the back button is pressed by the user.
    description: |
        This event is fired when the current window's activity detects
        a back button press by the user to navigate back.

        By default this event would trigger the current activity to be finished
        and removed from the task stack. Subscribing to this event with a listener
        will prevent the default behavior. To finish the activity from your listener
        just call the *close* method of the window.

        This event replaces the android:back event. Some behavior
        changes may exist such as the event no longer firing when the
        user dismisses the keyboard with the back button or when the
        user closes a full-screen video which is embedded in a web view
        with the back button.

        As of 5.0.0, you can create an event that can prevent accidental closure of the
        app due to hitting the back button to many times.

        ``` js
        var win = Ti.UI.createWindow(
            { // some code... }
        );
        // more code
        win.addEventListener("windows:back", function()
            { alert("Back pressed"); }

        and it is hosted in a navigation controller, then the top edge of the window is extended underneath the navigation bar so that part
        of the window is obscured. If the navigation bar is opaque (translucent property on window is false), then the top edge of the window
        will only extend if <Titanium.UI.Window.includeOpaqueBars> is set to true.

        The default behavior is to assume that no edges are to be extended. Must be specified before **opening** the window.

        system's UI elements (such as a translucent status-bar) and physical obstructions (such as the iPhone X
        rounded corners and top sensor housing) to overlap the window's content. In this case, it is the app
        developer's responsibility to position views so that they're unobstructed. On Android, you can use the
        [Window.safeAreaPadding](Titanium.UI.Window.safeAreaPadding) property after the window has been opened to
        layout your content within the insets.

        If set `false`, then the window's content will be laid out within the safe-area and its child views will be
        unobstructed. For example, you will not need to position a view below the top status-bar.

        Since Titanium SDK 6.0.0, you can use this property to hide and show the property as well.

        Using this property, the navigation bar will be hidden or shown animated by default. Please note that
        this property will only take effect if the window is used inside a <Titanium.UI.NavigationWindow>
        and will be ignored otherwise. If you want to hide or show the navigation without an animation, use t
        he methods <Titanium.UI.Window.showNavBar> and <Titanium.UI.Window.hideNavBar> with the second parameter
        to specify the animation:

        ``` js
        // "myWindow" is a Ti.UI.Window inside a Ti.UI.NavigationWindow
        myWindow.hideNavBar(true, {animated: false});
        ```

        #### Android Platform Notes

        Since Release 3.3.0, due to changes to support the appcompat library, this property has no
        effect. By default, the action bar is always displayed.  To hide the action bar, see the

        iOS notes: For modal windows that cover the previous window, the previous window is

        transition animation, but disappear as soon as the animation is completed. (In general
        all modal windows cover the previous window, except for iPad modal windows using the
        Page sheet or Form sheet style.)

        Android notes: If you set any of `windowSoftInputMode`, `fullscreen`, or `navBarHidden`,
        *and* you wish to use the `opacity` property at any time during the window's lifetime,
        be sure to set an `opacity` value **before** opening the window.  You can later change that
        value -- and you can set it to 1 for full opacity if you wish -- but the important thing
        is that you set it to a value before opening the window if you will want to set it at
        any time during the window's lifetime.

        The technical reason for this is that if the opacity property is present (i.e., has
        been set to something) and a new Android Activity is created for the window,
        then a translucent theme will be used for the Activity.  Window transparency (opacity
        values below 1) will only work in Android if the Activity's theme is translucent, and
        Titanium only uses a translucent theme for an Activity if you set an opacity property
        before opening the window.  Additionally, do not use `opacity` and `fullscreen: true`
        together, because translucent themes in Android cannot hide the status bar.  Finally,
        if you do set the `opacity` property, be sure to also set a `backgroundImage` or
        `backgroundColor` property as well, unless you want the window to be completely
        transparent.

    summary: |

    description: |
        **Note:** Using the `orientationModes` property to force the orientation of non-modal
        windows is considered a bad practice and will not be supported, including forcing the
        orientation of windows inside a NavigationWindow or TabGroup.

        To restrict this window to a certain set of orientations, specify one or more
        of the orientation constants [LANDSCAPE_LEFT](Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_LEFT),
        [LANDSCAPE_RIGHT](Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_RIGHT), [PORTRAIT](Titanium.UI.PORTRAIT),
        [UPSIDE_PORTRAIT](Titanium.UI.UPSIDE_PORTRAIT).

        `orientationModes` must be set **before** opening the window.

        To determine the current orientation of the *window*, see
        [Window.orientation](Titanium.UI.Window.orientation).
        To determine the current orientation of the *device*, see
        [Gesture.orientation](Titanium.Gesture.orientation).
        To be notified when the device's current orientation changes, add a listener for the
        <Titanium.Gesture.orientationchange> event.

        #### Android Orientation Modes

        On Android, orientation behavior is dependent on the Android SDK level
        of the device itself. Devices running Android 2.3 and above support "sensor portait
        mode" and "sensor landscape mode," in these modes, the device is locked into
        either a portrait or landscape orientation, but can switch between the normal and reverse
        orientations (for example, between PORTRAIT and UPSIDE_PORTRAIT).

        In addition, the definition of portrait or
        landscape mode can vary based on the physical design of the device. For example,
        on some devices <Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_LEFT> represents the top of the device being at
        the 270 degree position but other devices may (based on camera position for example)
        treat this position as <Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_RIGHT>. In general, applications for
        Android that need to be aware of orientation should try and limit their orientation
        logic to handling either portrait or landscape rather than worrying about the reverse
        modes. This approach will allow the orientation modes to adopt a more natural feel for
        the specific device.

        The following list breaks down the orientation behavior on Android based on the contents
        of the `orientationModes` array:

        1.  Empty array. Enables orientation to be fully controlled by the device sensor.

        2.  Array includes one or both portrait modes **and** one or both landscape modes.
            Enables full sensor control (identical to an empty array).

        3.  Array contains PORTRAIT **and** UPSIDE_PORTRAIT. On Android 2.3 and above,
            enables sensor portrait mode. This means the screen will shift between
            both portrait modes according to the sensor inside the device.

            On Android versions below 2.3, locks screen orientation in normal portrait mode.

        4.  Array contains LANDSCAPE_LEFT **and** LANDSCAPE_RIGHT. On Android 2.3 and above,
            enables sensor landscape mode. This means the screen will shift between both
            landscape modes according to the sensor inside the device.

            On Android versions below 2.3, locks screen orientation in normal landscape mode.

        5.  Array contains **only** [PORTRAIT](Titanium.UI.PORTRAIT). Locks screen orientation
            to normal portrait mode.

        6.  Array contains **only** [LANDSCAPE_LEFT](Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_LEFT). Locks screen
            orientation to normal landscape mode.

        7.  Array contains **only** [UPSIDE_PORTRAIT](Titanium.UI.UPSIDE_PORTRAIT). On
            Android 2.3 and above, locks screen in reverse portrait mode.

            On Android versions below 2.3, results are undefined.

        8.  Array contains **only**  [LANDSCAPE_RIGHT](Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_RIGHT). On
            Android 2.3 and above, locks screen in reverse landscape mode.

            On Android versions below 2.3, results are undefined.

  - name: safeAreaPadding
    platforms: [android, iphone, ipad]
    summary: The padding needed to safely display content without it being overlapped by the screen insets and notches.
    description: |
        When setting [Window.extendSafeArea](Titanium.UI.Window.extendSafeArea) to `true`, the system's insets
        such as a translucent status bar, translucent navigation bar, and/or camera notches will be allowed to
        overlay on top of the window's content. In this case, it is the app developer's responsibility to
        prevent these insets from overlapping key content such as buttons. This property provides the amount of
        space needed to be added to the left, top, right, and bottom edges of the window root view to do this.

        This property won't return values greater than zero until the window has been opened. It is recommended
        that you read this property via a <Titanium.UI.View.postlayout> event listener since the padding values can
        change when when the app's orientation changes or when showing/hiding the action bar.

        If the [Window.extendSafeArea](Titanium.UI.Window.extendSafeArea) property is set `false`, then the
        returned padding will be all zeros since the root content will be positioned between all insets.

        Below is an example on how to set up a safe-area view container using this property.

        ``` js
        // Set up a window with a translucent top status bar and translucent nav bar.
        // This will only work on Android 4.4 and newer OS versions.
        var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
            extendSafeArea: true,
            theme: 'Theme.AppCompat.NoTitleBar',
            windowFlags: Ti.UI.Android.FLAG_TRANSLUCENT_NAVIGATION | Ti.UI.Android.FLAG_TRANSLUCENT_STATUS
        });

        // Set up a safe-area view to be layed out between the system insets.
        // You should use this as a container for child views.
        var safeAreaView = Ti.UI.createView({
            backgroundColor: 'green'
        });
        win.add(safeAreaView);
        win.addEventListener('postlayout', function() {
            // Update the safe-area view's dimensions after every 'postlayout' event.
            safeAreaView.applyProperties(win.safeAreaPadding);
        });

        **Note:** The recommended way of creating windows with their own context is to either use the

        [CommonJS module](https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/CommonJS_Modules_in_Titanium)
        than using this property. One benefit of using a CommonJS module is that it consumes less
        resources.

        Use this property to have Windows load a JavaScript file in its own subcontext and thread,
        separate from the `app.js` global context.
        Reference a file relative to your project's `Resources` folder for classic Titanium
        projects or `app/lib` folder for Alloy projects.

        Note that Titanium will refuse to load JavaScript files from a remote URL. Loading
        remote JavaScript from a URL and providing it with the full capabilities of the Titanium
        API would be very dangerous.

        When loading JavaScript files using this property, the special property
