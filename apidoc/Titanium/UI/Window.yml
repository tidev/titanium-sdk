    summary: Fired when the back button is pressed by the user.
    description: |
        This event is fired when the current window's activity detects
        a back button press by the user to navigate back.

        By default this event would trigger the current activity to be finished
        and removed from the task stack. Subscribing to this event with a listener
        will prevent the default behavior. To finish the activity from your listener
        just call the *close* method of the window.

        This event replaces the android:back event. Some behavior
        changes may exist such as the event no longer firing when the
        user dismisses the keyboard with the back button or when the
        user closes a full-screen video which is embedded in a web view
        with the back button.

        An array of supported values specified using the EXTEND_EDGE constants in <Titanium.UI>. Valid on iOS 7 and greater.
    description:  |
        This is only valid for windows hosted by navigation controllers or tab bar controllers. This property is used to
        determine the layout of the window within its parent view controller. For example if the window is specified to extend its top edge
        and it is hosted in a navigation controller, then the top edge of the window is extended underneath the navigation bar so that part
        of the window is obscured. If the navigation bar is opaque (translucent property on window is false), then the top edge of the window
        will only extend if <Titanium.UI.Window.includeOpaqueBars> is set to true. 

        The default behavior is to assume that no edges are to be extended. Must be specified before **opening** the window.

        A fullscreen window occupies all of the screen space, hiding the status bar. Must be specified
        at creation time or in the `options` dictionary passed to the [Window.open](Titanium.UI.Window.open) method.

        On iOS the behavior of this property has changed. Starting from 3.1.3, if this property is undefined
        then the property is set to the value for UIStatusBarHidden defined in tiapp.xml.
        If that is not defined it is treated as **explicit false**. On earlier versions, opening a window with this property
        undefined would not effect the status bar appearance.

        On Android, setting this property forces the creation of a heavyweight window before Titanium 3.2.0.

    description: |
        Must be specified at creation time or in the `options` dictionary passed to the
        [Window.open](Titanium.UI.Window.open) method.

        Android note:  Android modal windows are translucent. Before Android API 14, everything behind the
        modal window is blurred. On API 14 and above, blurring is no longer supported and will not work as expected because the flag
        [FLAG_BLUR_BEHIND](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams.html#FLAG_BLUR_BEHIND)
        is deprecated. The combination of `fullscreen:true` and `modal:true` will not work as
        expected. In Android, the contents of a translucent window cannot appear above the status bar.  I.e. even though
        you set `fullscreen:true`, the status bar will still be visible *if* it was visible
        in the previous window. `navBarHidden` and `modal` do work fine together, however.

        On Android, setting this property forces the creation of a heavyweight window before Titanium 3.2.0. See "Android
        Heavyweight and Lightweight Windows" in the main description of this class for more
        information.
        
        iOS note: modal windows should not support orientation modes that the
        window they are opened over do not support. Doing otherwise *may* cause
        bad visual/redraw behavior after the modal is dismissed, due to how
        iOS manages modal transitions. Beginning with 3.1.3, if the orientationModes property of a 
        modal window is undefined, then the orientations supported by this window would be the orientationModes
        specified by tiapp.xml.
        
        Mobile Web and Tizen note: On Mobile Web and Tizen, windows are always modal, blocking input to underlying 
        windows. If the window does not occupy the full screen, setting `modal` to `true` provides 
        a visual cue by dimming any background windows. If the window occupies the full screen, 
        `modal` has no effect.

        On the BlackBerry platform, the very first window in the application cannot be modal, therefore the modal flag will be ignored
        if set on the first window.

        On Mobile Web, Tizen, iOS, and BlackBerry the modal property has no effect on whether the window is 
        translucent or opaque.

        **Beginning with 3.1.3**, this is no longer a valid parameter passed to the [Window.open](Titanium.UI.Window.open) method.
        Modal windows on iOS no longer have a navigation controller and hence **do not** have a nav bar.

        On Android, setting this property forces the creation of a heavyweight window before Titanium 3.2.0. See "Android

        iOS Notes: For modal windows that cover the previous window, the previous window is 
        removed from the render stack after the modal window finishes opening. If the 
        modal window is semi-transparent, the underlying window will be visible during the 
        transition animation, but disappear as soon as the animation is completed. (In general 
        all modal windows cover the previous window, except for iPad modal windows using the 
        Page sheet or Form sheet style.)

        Android Notes: If you set any of `windowSoftInputMode`, `fullscreen`, or `navBarHidden`,
        *and* you wish to use the `opacity` property at any time during the window's lifetime,
        be sure to set an `opacity` value **before** opening the window.  You can later change that
        value -- and you can set it to 1 for full opacity if you wish -- but the important thing
        is that you set it to a value before opening the window if you will want to set it at
        any time during the window's lifetime.

        The technical reason for this is that if the opacity property is present (i.e., has
        been set to something) and a new Android Activity is created for the window,
        then a translucent theme will be used for the Activity.  Window transparency (opacity
        values below 1) will only work in Android if the Activity's theme is translucent, and
        Titanium only uses a translucent theme for an Activity if you set an opacity property
        before opening the window.  Additionally, do not use `opacity` and `fullscreen: true`
        together, because translucent themes in Android cannot hide the status bar.  Finally,
        if you do set the `opacity` property, be sure to also set a `backgroundImage` or
        `backgroundColor` property as well, unless you want the window to be completely
        transparent.

        [UPSIDE_PORTRAIT](Titanium.UI.UPSIDE_PORTRAIT).

        `orientationModes` must be set **before** opening the window.

        To determine the current orientation of the *window*, see
        [Window.orientation](Titanium.UI.Window.orientation).
        To determine the current orientation of the *device*, see
        [Gesture.orientation](Titanium.Gesture.orientation). 
        To be notified when the device's current orientation changes, add a listener for the 
        <Titanium.Gesture.orientationchange> event.

        #### Android Orientation Modes

        On Android, `orientationModes` only takes effect when specified on a heavyweight
        window.

        On Android, orientation behavior is dependent on the Android SDK level
        of the device itself. Devices running Android 2.3 and above support "sensor portait
        mode" and "sensor landscape mode," in these modes, the device is locked into
        either a portrait or landscape orientation, but can switch between the normal and reverse
        orientations (for example, between PORTRAIT and UPSIDE_PORTRAIT).

        In addition, the definition of portrait or
        landscape mode can vary based on the physical design of the device. For example,
        on some devices <Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_LEFT> represents the top of the device being at
        the 270 degree position but other devices may (based on camera position for example)
        treat this position as <Titanium.UI.LANDSCAPE_RIGHT>. In general, applications for
        Android that need to be aware of orientation should try and limit their orientation
        logic to handling either portrait or landscape rather than worrying about the reverse
        modes. This approach will allow the orientation modes to adopt a more natural feel for
        the specific device.

        The following list breaks down the orientation behavior on Android based on the contents
        of the `orientationModes` array:

        1.  Empty array. Enables orientation to be fully controlled by the device sensor.

        2.  Array includes one or both portrait modes **and** one or both landscape modes.
            Enables full sensor control (identical to an empty array).

        3.  Array contains PORTRAIT **and** UPSIDE_PORTRAIT. On Android 2.3 and above,
            enables sensor portrait mode. This means the screen will shift between
            both portrait modes according to the sensor inside the device.

  - name: url
    summary: Loads a JavaScript file from a local URL.
    description: |
        **Note:** The recommended way of creating windows with their own context is to either use the
        [Alloy Framework](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/guide/Alloy_Framework) or a
        [CommonJS module](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/guide/CommonJS_Modules_in_Titanium)
        than using this property.  One benefit of using a CommonJS module is that it consumes less
        resources.

        Use this property to have Windows load a JavaScript file in its own subcontext and thread,
        separate from the `app.js` global context.
        Reference a file relative to your project's `Resources` folder for classic Titanium
        projects or `app/lib` folder for Alloy projects.

        Note that Titanium will refuse to load JavaScript files from a remote URL. Loading
        remote JavaScript from a URL and providing it with the full capabilities of the Titanium
        API would be very dangerous.

        When loading JavaScript files using this property, the special property
        <Titanium.UI.currentWindow> is available inside a multi-context
        application that points to the JavaScript instance by reference in the global context.

  - name: windowSoftInputMode
    summary: |
        Determines whether a heavyweight window's soft input area (ie software keyboard) is visible 
        as it receives focus and how the window behaves in order to accomodate it while keeping its 
        contents in view.
    description: |
        In order for this property to take effect on an emulator, its Android Virtual Device (AVD) 
        must be configured with the `Keyboard Support` setting set to `No`. Note that it is always 
        recommended to test an application on a physical device to understand its true behavior.

        Setting this property forces the creation of a heavyweight window before Titanium 3.2.0. See "Android Heavyweight
        and Lightweight Windows" in the main description of this class for more information.
        
        This property is capable of representing two settings from the following two groups of 
        settings using the [bitwise OR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR) operation. 
        
        One of the group of soft input *visibility* constants, 
        [SOFT_INPUT_STATE_ALWAYS_HIDDEN](Titanium.UI.Android.SOFT_INPUT_STATE_ALWAYS_HIDDEN), 
        [SOFT_INPUT_STATE_ALWAYS_VISIBLE](Titanium.UI.Android.SOFT_INPUT_STATE_ALWAYS_VISIBLE), 
        [SOFT_INPUT_STATE_HIDDEN](Titanium.UI.Android.SOFT_INPUT_STATE_HIDDEN), 
        [SOFT_INPUT_STATE_UNSPECIFIED](Titanium.UI.Android.SOFT_INPUT_STATE_UNSPECIFIED), 
        or [SOFT_INPUT_STATE_VISIBLE](Titanium.UI.Android.SOFT_INPUT_STATE_VISIBLE).
        
        One of the group of soft input *adjustment* constants, 
        [SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_UNSPECIFIED](Titanium.UI.Android.SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_UNSPECIFIED), 
        [SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_RESIZE](Titanium.UI.Android.SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_RESIZE), 
        or [SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_PAN](Titanium.UI.Android.SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_PAN).
        
        Note that in Javascript, bitwise OR is achieved using the single pipe operand. See the 
        example for a demonstration.

    type: Number

description: |
    A window is a top-level container which can contain other views. Windows can
    be *opened* and *closed*.  Opening a window causes the window and its child 
    views to be added to the application's render stack, on top of any previously opened 
    windows. Closing a window removes the window and its children from the render stack.

    Windows *contain* other views, but in general they are not *contained* inside
    other views. There are a few specialized views that manage windows:
    
    * [NavigationWindow](Titanium.UI.iOS.NavigationWindow)
    * [SplitWindow](Titanium.UI.iPad.SplitWindow)
    * [TabGroup](Titanium.UI.TabGroup)
    * [Tab](Titanium.UI.Tab)
    * [NavigationGroup](Titanium.UI.MobileWeb.NavigationGroup)

    By default, windows occupy the entire screen except for the navigation bar, 
    status bar, and in the case of windows contained in tab groups, the tab bar.
    To take up the entire screen, covering any other UI, specify `fullscreen:true`
    when creating the window.

    To create a window, use the <Titanium.UI.createWindow> method in your JavaScript files
    or the &lt;Window&gt; XML element for Alloy views.

    ### Pass Context Between Windows

    To pass data between windows, use a
    [CommonJS module](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/guide/CommonJS_Modules_in_Titanium)
    to save information from one window then retrieve it in another.  In the example below, the foo
    module exposes two methods to store and retrieve an object.  The first window of the project
    loads the foo module and uses the set method to store some data before opening the second window.
    The second window loads the same module and is able to retrieve the content saved by the first
    window with the get method.

    Note that for Alloy projects, you can simply pass the context as the second argument of the
    Alloy.createController method, then retrieve the data with the special variable `arguments[0]`
    in the controller code.

    `app/lib/foo.js`:

        // For a classic Titanium project, save the file to 'Resources/foo.js'
        var data = {};
        function setData (obj){
            data = obj;
        }
        function getData () {  
            return data;
        }

        // The special variable 'exports' exposes the functions as public
        exports.setData = setData;
        exports.getData = getData;

    `app/views/index.xml`:

        <Alloy>
            <Window backgroundColor="blue">
                <Label onClick="openWindow">Open the Red Window!</Label>
            </Window>
        </Alloy>

    `app/controllers/index.xml`:

        var foo = require('foo');
        foo.setData({foobar: 42});

        function openWindow () {
            var win2 = Alloy.createController('win2').getView();
            // For Alloy projects, you can pass context
            // to the controller in the Alloy.createController method.
            // var win2 = Alloy.createController('win2', {foobar: 42}).getView();
            win2.open();
        }

        $.index.open();

    `app/views/win2.xml`:

        <Alloy>
            <Window backgroundColor="red">
                <Label id="label">I am a red window.</Label>
            </Window>
        </Alloy>

    `app/controllers/win2.js`:

        var foo = require('foo');
        $.label.text = foo.getData().foobar;

        // For Alloy projects, you can also pass in context
        // with the Alloy.createController method and retrieve
        // it in the controller code.
        // var args = arguments[0] || {};
        // $.label.text = args.foobar;

    ### Animations

    Windows can be animated like a [View](Titanium.UI.View), such as using an animation
    to open or close a window.  The example below creates a window
    that opens from small to large with a bounce effect.  This is done by applying a
    transformation at initialization time that scales the original size of the window to 0.
    When the window is opened, a new 2D transformation is applied that will scale the window
    size from 0 to 110% of it's original size, then, after 1/20th of a second, it is scaled
    back to it's original size at 100%. This gives the bounce effect during animation.

    `app/views/index.xml`:

        <Alloy>
            <Window backgroundColor="blue" onPostlayout="animateOpen" >
                <Label color="orange">Animated Window</Label>
            </Window>
        </Alloy>

    `app/controllers/index.js`:

        $.index.transform = Titanium.UI.create2DMatrix().scale(0);
        $.index.open();

        var a = Ti.UI.createAnimation({
            transform : Ti.UI.create2DMatrix().scale(1.1),
            duration : 2000,
        });
        a.addEventListener('complete', function(){
            $.index.animate({
                transform: Ti.UI.create2DMatrix(),
                duration: 200
            });
        });

        function animateOpen() {
            $.index.animate(a);
        }

    Note that to animate an Android heavyweight window while you open it, you need
    to follow a specific procedure which is explained below in "Heavyweight
    Window Transitions in Android".

    ### iOS Platform Notes

    #### iOS Transition Animations

    iOS contains built-in transition animations when switching between non-modal windows. In the Window's
    `open` method, set the `transition` property to a `Titanium.UI.iPhone.AnimationStyle` constant to use an animation.
    For example, to flip right-to-left between two windows:

    `app/views/index.xml`:

        <Alloy>
            <Window backgroundColor="blue" onOpen="animateOpen">
                <Label id="label">I am a blue window!</Label>
            </Window>
        </Alloy>

    `app/controllers/index.js`

        function animateOpen() {
            var window2 = Alloy.createController('win2').getView();
            window2.open({transition:Ti.UI.iPhone.AnimationStyle.FLIP_FROM_LEFT});
        }
        $.index.open();

    `app/views/win2.xml`:

        <Alloy>
            <Window backgroundColor="red">
                <Label id="label">I am a red window!</Label>
            </Window>
        </Alloy>

    In the above example, the red window will be animated from the right-to-left over the blue window.

    Starting with iOS 7, you can create transition animations when opening and closing windows in
    either a <Titanium.UI.iOS.NavigationWindow> or <Titanium.UI.Tab>.

    Use the <Titanium.UI.iOS.createTransitionAnimation> method to specify an animation objects to hide and
    show the window, then set the newly created TransitionAnimation object to the window's
    <Titanium.UI.Window.transitionAnimation> property.

    In the example below, the windows are closed by rotating them upside down while simulatenously
    making them transparent:

    `app/views/index.xml`:

        <Alloy>
            <NavigationWindow platform="ios">
                <Window id="redwin" title="Red Window" backgroundColor="red">
                    <Button id="button" onClick="openBlueWindow">Open Blue Window</Button>
                </Window>
            </NavigationWindow>
        </Alloy>

    `app/controllers/index.js`:

        function openBlueWindow(e) {
            var bluewin = Alloy.createController('bluewin').getView();
            $.index.openWindow(bluewin);
        }

        $.redwin.transitionAnimation = Ti.UI.iOS.createTransitionAnimation({
            duration: 300,
            // The show transition makes the window opaque and rotates it correctly
            transitionTo: {
                opacity: 1,
                duration: 300,
                transform: Ti.UI.create2DMatrix()
            },
            // The hide transition makes the window transparent and rotates it upside down
            transitionFrom: {
                opacity: 0,
                duration: 300 / 2,
                transform: Ti.UI.create2DMatrix().rotate(180),
            }
        });

        $.index.open();

    `app/views/bluewin.xml`:

        <Alloy>
            <Window title="Blue Window" backgroundColor="blue" opacity="0">
                <Button onClick="closeWindow">Close Window</Button>
            </Window>
        </Alloy>

    `app/controllers/bluewin.js`:

        function closeWindow(){
            $.bluewin.close();
        }

        $.bluewin.transitionAnimation = Ti.UI.iOS.createTransitionAnimation({
            duration: 300,
            // The show transition makes the window opaque and rotates it correctly
            transitionTo: {
                opacity: 1,
                duration: 300,
                transform: Ti.UI.create2DMatrix()
            },
            // The hide transition makes the window transparent and rotates it upside down
            transitionFrom: {
                opacity: 0,
                duration: 300 / 2,
                transform: Ti.UI.create2DMatrix().rotate(180),
            }
        });

        $.bluewin.transform = Ti.UI.create2DMatrix().rotate(180);

    #### iPad Modal Windows

    For iPad, in addition to full-screen modal windows, iPad supports "Page sheet"
    and "Form sheet" style windows:

    * **Page sheet** style windows have a fixed width, equal to the width of the screen 
      in portait mode, and a height equal to the *current* height of the screen. This means
      that in portrait mode, the window covers the entire screen. In landscape mode, 
      the window is centered on the screen horizontally.

    * **Form sheet** style windows are smaller than the screen size, and centered on the screen.

    The example below is a modal window using the Form sheet style:

    ![modal](http://img.skitch.com/20100406-bqb3f8pb6e4ger7wkcdcw5mbar.png)

    You can create this type of modal window on iPad with the following code snippet:

        var window = Titanium.UI.createWindow();
        window.open({
          modal:true,
          modalTransitionStyle: Ti.UI.iPhone.MODAL_TRANSITION_STYLE_FLIP_HORIZONTAL,
          modalStyle: Ti.UI.iPhone.MODAL_PRESENTATION_FORMSHEET
        })

    ### Android Platform Notes

    #### Android Heavyweight and Lightweight Windows

    ***Before Titanium 3.2.0*** in Android, Titanium windows can be heavyweight or lightweight:

    - A *heavyweight* window is associated with a new Android 
      [Activity](Titanium.Android.Activity).

    - A *lightweight* window is a fullscreen view, and runs in the current Android Activity.

    The [createWindow](Titanium.UI.createWindow) call creates a heavyweight window 
    if any of the following properties are defined (set to either `true` or `false`)
    on creation:

    * `fullscreen`
    * `navBarHidden`
    * `modal`
    * `windowSoftInputMode`

    ***Starting from Titanium 3.2.0*** in Android, all the windows are heavyweight. If you still want
    the old behavior, you can enable the `ti.android.useLegacyWindow` property in the `tiapp.xml`:

        <property name="ti.android.useLegacyWindow" type="bool">true</property>

    A heavyweight window is always created when you open a new window from inside a 
    [TabGroup](Titanium.UI.TabGroup).

    #### Heavyweight Window Transitions in Android

    As explained above, heavyweight windows are their own Android Activity. The only way
    to animate the opening or closing of an Activity in Android is to apply an animation _resource_
    to it.  Passing a <Titanium.UI.Animation> object as a parameter to <Titanium.UI.Window.open>
    or <Titanium.UI.Window.close> will have no effect if the window being opened/closed is heavyweight
    and thus opens/closes its own Activity.

    Instead, in the parameter dictionary you pass to <Titanium.UI.Window.open> or <Titanium.UI.Window.close>,
    you should set the `activityEnterAnimation` and `activityExitAnimation` keys to
    animation resources. `activityEnterAnimation` should be set to the animation you want to run
    on the incoming activity, while `activityExitAnimation` should be set to the animation you
    want to run on the outgoing activity that you are leaving.

    Animation resources are available through the `R` object. Use either <Titanium.Android.R> for
    built-in resources or <Titanium.App.Android.R> for resources that you package in your application.

    As an example, you may wish for the window that you are opening to fade in while the window
    you are leaving should fade out:

        var win2 = Ti.UI.createWindow({
            fullscreen: false // Makes it heavyweight before Titanium 3.2.0
        });

        win2.open({
            activityEnterAnimation: Ti.Android.R.anim.fade_in,
            activityExitAnimation: Ti.Android.R.anim.fade_out
        });

    See the official Android [R.anim](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.anim.html) documentation
    for information about built-in animations.

    For information on creating your own animation resource XML files, see "[View Animation](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/animation-resource.html#View)"
    in Android's Resources documentation. After creating an animation resource file, you can place it under
    `platform/android/res/anim` in your Titanium project folder and it will be packaged in your app's APK
    and then available via <Titanium.App.Android.R>.

    #### Android "root" Windows

    In Android, you may wish to specify that a window which you create (such as the first
    window) should be considered the root window and that the application should exit when
    the back button is pressed from that window.  This is particularly useful if your application
    is not using a Tab Group and therefore the splash screen window is appearing whenever you
    press the back button from your lowest window on the stack.

    To indicate that a particular window should cause an application to exit when the back
    button is pressed, pass `exitOnClose: true` as one of the creation arguments, as shown here:

        var win = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
          title: 'My Root Window',
          exitOnClose: true
        });


examples:
  - title: Full Screen Window example
    example: |
        Create a fullscreen window with a red background.

            var window = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
               backgroundColor:'red'
            });
            window.open({fullscreen:true});

  - title: Alloy XML Markup
    example: |
        Previous example as an Alloy view.

            <Alloy>
                <Window id="win" backgroundColor="red" fullscreen="true" />
            </Alloy>
