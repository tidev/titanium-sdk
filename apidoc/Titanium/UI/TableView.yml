name: Titanium.UI.TableView
summary: A Table View allows you to create a scrollable table of content in a list-based fashion.
description: |
     A table view can contain a set of [TableViewRow](Titanium.UI.TableViewRow)s, each displaying 
     an item of data. The default `TableViewRow` has properties for adding text, as well as 
     optional images on the left and right sides, and various system-provided indicators, 
     such as check marks. Table view rows can also be fully customized by adding child views, 
     such as labels, buttons, or image views.

     When adding rows to a table view, each row can be passed as a 
     [TableViewRow](Titanium.UI.TableViewRow) object, or as dictionary specifying 
     the properties for a table row, in which case the `TableView` will create 
     `TableViewRow` objects as needed. 
     
     Use the <Titanium.UI.createTableView> method to create a table view.

    parameters:
      - name: index

  - name: scrollToTop
    summary: Scrolls the table to a specific top position where 0 is the topmost y position in the table view.
    description: |
        The behavior of this method is platform-specific.

        On Android, the `top` value is interpreted as a row index that should be scrolled 
        to the top of the screen. The table will not scroll the last row of data higher than
        the bottom of the screen. If there is less than one screenful of data below the 
        specified row, the table doesn't scroll the specified row all the way to the top.
        If the table has less than one screenful of data total, it does not scroll at all.

        On iOS, the `top` value is interpreted as a pixel offset between the top of the top
        row of data and the top of the table view. So a `top` value of 0 scrolls the list to
        the top. A positive value scrolls it down, and a negative value scrolls the list up
        above the first item.
        
        On Mobile Web, the `top` value is interpreted as a pixel offset between the top of the top
        row of data and the top of the table view. So a `top` value of 0 scrolls the list to
        the top. A positive value scrolls it down. Values outside the scrollable range are clipped
        so that negative numbers scroll the list to the top, and large positive values scroll the
        list to the bottom.

        On iOS, specify a <TableViewAnimationProperties> object with `animated` set to `false` to 
        disable the scrolling animation.

      - name: top
        summary: Y position for the top of the table view.
