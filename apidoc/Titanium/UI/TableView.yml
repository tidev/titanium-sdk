    A `TableView` object is a container for [TableViewSection](Titanium.UI.TableViewSection)
    objects that are, in turn, containers for [TableViewRow](Titanium.UI.TableViewRow) objects.

    Use the <Titanium.UI.createTableView> method or **`<TableView>`** Alloy element to create a `TableView`.

    Also see the [TableViews guide](https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/TableViews).

    #### Creating Tables

    There are few approaches to creating and using `TableView` object.

    The simplest approach is to pass dictionaries of `TableViewRow` properties, such as
    [backgroundColor](Titanium.UI.TableViewRow.backgroundColor),
    [color](Titanium.UI.TableViewRow.color), and [title](Titanium.UI.TableViewRow.title), to the
    [createTableView](Titanium.UI.createTableView) method, which causes the rows to be implictly
    created, added to a single [TableViewSection](Titanium.UI.TableViewSection), and then added to
    the `TableView`. Refer to the "Simple Table View with Basic Rows" example.

    For more control over the layout of each row, however, [TableViewRow](Titanium.UI.TableViewRow)
    objects can be created explicitly using the <Titanium.UI.createTableViewRow> method. Child views,
    such as [labels](Titanium.UI.Label), [images](Titanium.UI.ImageView), and
    [buttons](Titanium.UI.Button), may be added to each row. When one or more
    [rows](Titanium.UI.TableViewRow) are added to the table view,
    a single [TableViewSection](Titanium.UI.TableViewSection) is automatically created to hold the
    rows. See the "Table View with Composite Layout" example.

    Lastly, sets of rows may be explicitly created and added to a their own
    [TableViewSection](Titanium.UI.TableViewSection) objects, which are then added to a `TableView`,
    to enable the rows to be organized. Headers and footers titles or views must be configured
    in order for the sections to be visible.

    #### Tables and Scroll Views

    As a table view inherently scrolls, it creates a very poor user experience when one contains
    other scrolling views, such as a [ScrollableView](Titanium.UI.ScrollableView) or
    [TextArea](Titanium.UI.TextArea). Thus, this layout is strongly discouraged.

    #### TextFields in Tables with SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_PAN (Android)

    When a [TextField](Titanium.UI.TextField) is placed in a row near the bottom of a `TableView`,
    in a window that is configured with
    [SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_PAN](Titanium.UI.Android.SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_PAN), it is expected for the
    text field to automatically move to a visible position after it is focused and the software
    keyboard displayed. However, due to a known problem caused by native Android's ListView behavior,
    the keyboard is likely to completely obscure the text field.

    To mitigate this, a `ScrollView` may be used instead of a table view, as demonstrated in the
    [ScrollView](Titanium.UI.ScrollView), "Scroll View as a Table View", example.

    #### Known Issues

    There are known issues with the `sections` property and associated methods added in
    Release 3.0:

    *   On iOS, the first two arguments to the `updateSection` method are reversed.
        ([TIMOB-12625](https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/TIMOB-12625)). This issue has been
        addressed in Release 3.3.0 of the Titanium SDK

    #### Row Editing and Moving Modes (iOS only)

    On iOS, table views have an `editing` and a `moving` mode that may be activated to using their
    respective [editing](Titanium.UI.TableView.editing) and [moving](Titanium.UI.TableView.moving)
    properties. These allow rows to be deleted or re-ordered by the user, depending on each row's
    [editable](Titanium.UI.TableViewRow.editable) and [moveable](Titanium.UI.TableViewRow.moveable)
    property that are either explicitly set or inherited from the table.

    There are two UI controls available for deleting table view rows, depending on the combination
    of editing and moving modes enabled:

    * "red icon delete" - a circular red icon is displayed on the left-hand side of a row, which
    reveals a delete button on the right-hand side of that row when clicked.
    * "swipe delete" - without either of the table editing or moving modes enabled, a left or right
    swipe gesture on a row reveals a delete button on the right-hand side of the row.

    Note that because the operating system handles the functionality of the swipe delete, the OS will
    capture swipe events and not bubble the event to Titanium listeners. As such, if you rely on
    swipe events, you must not set editing to true on such rows, and simulate the functionality you
    need.

    When `editable` and `moveable` properties are set on the table view, they are known as `inherited`,
    whereas when set on a row, they are known as `explicit`. As their resulting behavior may not
    follow their literal meaning, depending on the combination of `editing` and `moving` modes that
    are enabled, a detailed description of the behavior follows.

    With `editing:false` and `moving:true`:

    * For red icon delete and swipe delete, inherited and explicit `editable` properties may be set.
    * Inherited `moveable` property is always `true`. Explicit `moveable` property may be set.

    With `editing:true` and `moving:false`:

    * For red icon delete and swipe delete, inherited `editable` property is always `true`. Explicit
    `editable` property may be set.
    * Inherited and explicit `moveable` properties may be set.

    With `editing:false` and `moving: false`:

    * For red icon delete, inherited and explicit `editable` properties always `false`. For
    swipe delete, inherited and explicit `editable` properties may be set.
    * Inherited `moveable` property is always `false`.

    With `editing:true` and `moving:true`:

    * For red icon delete and swipe delete, inherited and explicit `editable` properties may be set.
    * Inherited `moveable` property is always `true`. Explicit `moveable` property may be set.

  - name: scrollToTop
    summary: |
        Scrolls the table to a specific top position where 0 is the topmost y position in the
        table view.
    description: |
        The behavior of this method is platform-specific.

        On Android, the `top` value is interpreted as a row index that should be scrolled
        to the top of the screen. The table will not scroll the last row of data higher than
        the bottom of the screen. If there is less than one screenful of data below the
        specified row, the table doesn't scroll the specified row all the way to the top.
        If the table has less than one screenful of data total, it does not scroll at all.

        On iOS, the `top` value is interpreted as a pixel offset between the top of the top
        row of data and the top of the table view. So a `top` value of 0 scrolls the list to
        the top. A positive value scrolls it down, and a negative value scrolls the list up
        above the first item.

        On iOS, specify a <TableViewAnimationProperties> object with `animated` set to `false` to
        disable the scrolling animation.
    parameters:
      - name: top
        summary: Y position for the top of the table view.
        type: Number

  - name: setContentInsets
    summary: Sets this tableview's content insets.
    description: |
        A table view is essentially a scroll view that contains a set of static row views that
        represents the content. Thus, the `setContentInsets` method facilitates a margin, or inset,
        distance between the content and the container scroll view.

        Typically used with the [headerPullView](Titanium.UI.TableView.headerPullView) property.
    parameters:
      - name: edgeInsets
        summary: |
          Sets the distance that the content view is inset from the enclosing scroll view of the table.
          For example:

          ``` js
          setContentInset({ top: 50, bottom: 10, right: 10, left: 10 }, { animated: true });
          ```
        type: Padding

  - name: headerPullView
    summary: |
        View positioned above the first row that is only revealed when the user drags the table
        contents down.
    description: |
        A `headerPullView` is a UI control that is often used to provide a convenient way for the
        user to refresh a table's data.  Typically used with the
        [setContentInsets](Titanium.UI.TableView.setContentInsets) method.

        To specify the wrapper color see <Titanium.UI.View.pullBackgroundColor>.

        For an example, see the "Pull to refresh" section in the
        [TableViews guide](https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/TableViews).

        Alloy applications can use a `<HeaderPullView>` element inside a `<TableView>` element.

        ``` xml
        <Alloy>
            <TableView>
                <HeaderPullView platform="ios">
                    <View class="pull">
                        <Label color="#F2F4F4" bottom="25dp">Header pull view</Label>
                    </View>
                </HeaderPullView>
            </TableView>
        </Alloy>

    since: { android: "6.2.0", iphone: "3.2.0", ipad: "3.2.0" }

  - name: hideSearchOnSelection
    summary: Determines whether the search field should hide on completion.
    description: |
        Set to `false` to prevent the search field from being hidden when an item in the search
        results is clicked.

        Many standard applications (such as Contacts) have a behavior equivalent to `false` for this
        value, but the default is `true` for legacy reasons.

        The Android platform behaves as though this value were `false`.
    type: Boolean
    default: true
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]

  - name: allowsMultipleSelectionDuringEditing
    summary: Determines whether multiple items of this table view can be selected at the same time while editing the table.

    platforms: [iphone, ipad]

  - name: allowsMultipleSelectionInteraction
    summary: Allows a two-finger pan gesture to automatically transition the table view into editing mode and start selecting rows.
    description: |
        Setting this property to true allows the user to start selecting multiple contiguous rows via a two-finger pan gesture. 
        If the table view is already in editing mode, the user can also select multiple rows via a one-finger pan gesture along 
        the edge of the table that contains editing controls (checkboxes). In order to support this behavior, 
        you must also set <Titanium.UI.TableView.allowsMultipleSelectionDuringEditing> to true.
        Once user interaction stops the <Titanium.UI.TableView.rowsselected> event is fired.
    type: Boolean
    default: false
