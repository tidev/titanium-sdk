summary: |
    A table view is used to present information, organized in sections and rows, in a 
    vertically-scrolling view.
description: |
    Use the <Titanium.UI.createTableView> method to create a `TableView`.
    
    A `TableView` object is a container for [TableViewSection](Titanium.UI.TableViewSection) 
    objects that are, in turn, containers for [TableViewRow](Titanium.UI.TableViewRow) objects. 
    
    #### Creating Tables
    
    Tables may be created in the following ways.
    
    The simplest approach is to pass dictionaries of `TableViewRow` properties, such as 
    [backgroundColor](Titanium.UI.TableViewRow.backgroundColor), 
    [color](Titanium.UI.TableViewRow.color), and [title](Titanium.UI.TableViewRow.title), to the 
    [createTableView](Titanium.UI.createTableView) method, which causes the rows to be implictly 
    created, added to a single [TableViewSection](Titanium.UI.TableViewSection), and then added to 
    the `TableView`. Refer to the "Simple Table View with Basic Rows" example.
    
    For more control over the layout of each row, however, [TableViewRow](Titanium.UI.TableViewRow) 
    objects can be created explicitly using the <Titanium.UI.createTableViewRow> method. Child views, 
    such as [labels](Titanium.UI.Label), [images](Titanium.UI.ImageView), and 
    [buttons](Titanium.UI.Button), may be added to each row. When passed passed to the table view, a 
    single [TableViewSection](Titanium.UI.TableViewSection) is automatically created to hold the 
    rows. See the "Table View with Composite Layout" example.
    
    Lastly, sets of rows may be explicitly created and added to a their own 
    [TableViewSection](Titanium.UI.TableViewSection) objects, which are then added to a `TableView`, 
    to enable the rows to be organized. Headers and footers titles or views must be configured 
    in order for the sections to be visible.
    
    #### Tables and Scroll Views
    
    As a table view inherently scrolls, it creates a very poor user experience when one contains 
    other scrolling views, such as a [ScrollableView](Titanium.UI.ScrollableView) or 
    [TextArea](Titanium.UI.TextArea). Thus, this layout is strongly discouraged. 
    
    #### TextFields in Tables with SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_PAN (Android)
    
    When a [TextField](Titanium.UI.TextField) is placed in a row near the bottom of a `TableView`, 
    in a window that is configured with 
    [SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_PAN](Titanium.UI.Android.SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_PAN), it is expected for the 
    text field to automatically move to a visible position after it is focused and the software 
    keyboard displayed. However, due to a known problem caused by native Android's ListView behavior, 
    the keyboard is likely to completely obscure the text field. 
    
    To mitigate this, a `ScrollView` may be used instead of a table view, as demonstrated in the 
    [ScrollView](Titanium.UI.ScrollView), "Scroll View as a Table View", example. 
    
    #### Row Editing and Moving Modes (iOS only)
    
    On iOS, table views have an `editing` and a `moving` mode that may be activated to using their 
    respective [editing](Titanium.UI.TableView.editing) and [moving](Titanium.UI.TableView.moving) 
    properties. These allow rows to be deleted or re-ordered by the user, depending on each row's 
    [editable](Titanium.UI.TableViewRow.editable) and [moveable](Titanium.UI.TableViewRow.moveable) 
    property that are either explicitly set or inherited from the table.
    
    There are two UI controls available for deleting table view rows, depending on the combination 
    of editing and moving modes enabled:
    
    * "red icon delete" - a circular red icon is displayed on the left-hand side of a row, which 
    reveals a delete button on the right-hand side of that row when clicked.
    * "swipe delete" - without either of the table editing or moving modes enabled, a left or right 
    swipe gesture on a row reveals a delete button on the right-hand side of the row.
    
    When `editable` and `moveable` properties are set on the table view, they are known as `inherited`, 
    whereas when set on a row, they are known as `explicit`. As their resulting behavior may not 
    follow their literal meaning, depending on the combination of `editing` and `moving` modes that 
    are enabled, a detailed description of the behavior follows.
    
    With `editing:false` and `moving:true`:
    
    * For red icon delete and swipe delete, inherited and explicit `editable` properties may be set.
    * Inherited `moveable` property is always `true`. Explicit `moveable` property may be set.
    
    With `editing:true` and `moving:false`:
    
    * For red icon delete and swipe delete, inherited `editable` property is always `true`. Explicit 
    `editable` property may be set.
    * Inherited and explicit `moveable` properties may be set.
    
    With `editing:false` and `moving: false`:
    
    * For red icon delete, inherited and explicit `editable` properties always `false`. For 
    swipe delete, inherited and explicit `editable` properties may be set.
    * Inherited `moveable` property is always `false`.
    
    With `editing:true` and `moving:true`:
    
    * For red icon delete and swipe delete, inherited and explicit `editable` properties may be set.
    * Inherited `moveable` property is always `true`. Explicit `moveable` property may be set.

        [scroll](Titanium.UI.TableView.scroll) event cannot occur concurrently. If a table begins 
        to scroll during a touch event, the appropriate row or table `touchcancel` event fire 
        before the `scroll` event begins.
        
        On Mobile Web, a scroll may occur in the middle of a touch, in which case a `touchend` 
        will fire immediately following the scroll.

  - name: scrollToIndex
    summary: Scrolls the table view to ensure that the specified row is on screen.
    description: |
        On iOS, specify a <TableViewAnimationProperties> object to control the position that
        the selected row is scrolled to, and whether scrolling is animated.

  - name: scrollToTop
    summary: |
        Scrolls the table to a specific top position where 0 is the topmost y position in the 
        table view.
    description: |
        The behavior of this method is platform-specific.
        
        On Android, the `top` value is interpreted as a row index that should be scrolled 
        to the top of the screen. The table will not scroll the last row of data higher than
        the bottom of the screen. If there is less than one screenful of data below the 
        specified row, the table doesn't scroll the specified row all the way to the top.
        If the table has less than one screenful of data total, it does not scroll at all.
        
        On iOS, the `top` value is interpreted as a pixel offset between the top of the top
        row of data and the top of the table view. So a `top` value of 0 scrolls the list to
        the top. A positive value scrolls it down, and a negative value scrolls the list up
        above the first item.
        
        On Mobile Web, the `top` value is interpreted as a pixel offset between the top of the top
        row of data and the top of the table view. So a `top` value of 0 scrolls the list to
        the top. A positive value scrolls it down. Values outside the scrollable range are clipped
        so that negative numbers scroll the list to the top, and large positive values scroll the
        list to the bottom.
        
        On iOS, specify a <TableViewAnimationProperties> object with `animated` set to `false` to 
        disable the scrolling animation.
    parameters:
      - name: top
        summary: Y position for the top of the table view.

  - name: setContentInsets
    summary: Sets this tableview's content insets.
    description: |
        A table view is essentially a scroll view that contains a set of static row views that 
        represents the content. Thus, the `setContentInsets` method facilitates a margin, or inset, 
        distance between the content and the container scroll view.
        
        Typically used with the [headerPullView](Titanium.UI.TableView.headerPullView) property.

      - name: edgeInsets
