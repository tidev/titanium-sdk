methods:
  - name: cancelAction
    summary: Cancel a banner to uncover the user interface.
    description: |
        A banner view action can cover your application's user interface. However, your application 
        continues to run, and receives events normally. If your application receives an event that 
        requires the user's attention, it can programmatically cancel the action and uncover its 
        interface by calling cancelAction. Canceling actions frequently can cause a loss of revenue 
        for your application.

properties:
  - name: adSize
    summary: Size of the advertisement when minimized.
    description: |
        Apple only allows setting ads as specific sizes, meaning that traditional view sizing does 
        not affect ads. Ads always display in full-screen mode when a user clicks on them. 
        
        Should be set to either [AD_SIZE_PORTRAIT](Titanium.UI.iOS.AD_SIZE_PORTRAIT) or 
        [AD_SIZE_LANDSCAPE](Titanium.UI.iOS.AD_SIZE_LANDSCAPE). Attempting to set this property to 
        any other value will cause an exception. 
        
        Users are still allowed to set the view's [width](Titanium.UI.View.width) and 
        [height](Titanium.UI.View.height), but this does not affect the size of the ad itself. It is 
        recommended that the `auto` value is used for these properties instead, to compute the 
        view's size from the adSize.
