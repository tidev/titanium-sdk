    summary: A banner view action can cover your application's user interface. However, your application continues to run, and receives events normally. If your application receives an event that requires the user's attention, it can programmatically cancel the action and uncover its interface by calling cancelAction. Canceling actions frequently can cause a loss of revenue for your application.

    description: |
        Apple only allows setting ad views as specific sizes, meaning that
        traditional view sizing does not affect ad views. Ads always
        display in full-screen mode when a user clicks on them. 
        Should be set to either [AD_SIZE_PORTRAIT](Titanium.UI.iOS.AD_SIZE_PORTRAIT)
        or [AD_SIZE_LANDSCAPE](Titanium.UI.iOS.AD_SIZE_LANDSCAPE).
        
        Users are still allowed to set the view's [size](Titanium.UI.View.size),
        but this does not affect the size of the ad itself. It is recommended
        That the `auto` value is used, to compute the view's size from the adSize.
