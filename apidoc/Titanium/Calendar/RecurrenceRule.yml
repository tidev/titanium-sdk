name: Titanium.Calendar.RecurrenceRule
summary: An object that is used to describe the recurrence pattern for a recurring event.
description: |
    On Android there is no option to have multiple recurrence rules set for the same event.
    Android always uses only the first element in the array passed to [recurrenceRules](Titanium.Calendar.Event.recurrenceRules).

    In case of having [daysOfTheWeek](Titanium.Calendar.RecurrenceRule.daysOfTheWeek) and [daysOfTheMonth](Titanium.Calendar.RecurrenceRule.daysOfTheWeek)
    for an event with a recurrence rule of type [RECURRENCEFREQUENCY_MONTHLY](Titanium.Calendar.RECURRENCEFREQUENCY_MONTHLY) only
    [daysOfTheWeek] will be used.
