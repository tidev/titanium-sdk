        Use this method to bulk-create events for faster performance.

        type: String
    platforms: [android, iphone, ipad, macos]

  - name: getEventsById
    summary: Gets multiple events with their specified identifier(s).
    description: |
        Use this method to bulk-fetch events for faster performance.
        Only successful events are returned, so the identifier of events
        should be used to compare which events were not fetched successfully.
    returns:
        type: Array<Titanium.Calendar.Event>
    parameters:
      - name: ids
        summary: Array of identifiers of events.

    description: |
        Use this method to bulk-delete events for faster performance.
        This method only returns the count of successfully deleted events.
        If it is important for apps to know whether the event was deleted or not,
        either use the [remove()](Titanium.Calendar.Event.remove) method, or 
        a single identifier that is passed as an array to this method.
        If a specified identifier event does not exist, it will not be treated as a count,
        so the count range can be in `0 <= count <= ids.length`.
    returns:
        type: Number
        summary: Count of successfully deleted events.

      - name: ids
