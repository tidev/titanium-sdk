        This method raises an exception if it is passed an event from another event store.

        When an event is saved, it is updated in the Calendar database. Any fields you did
        not modify are updated to reflect the most recent value in the database. If the
        event has been deleted from the database, it is re-created as a new event.

        On Android, this method only updates the recurrence rule (if set). See [TIMOB-24248](https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/TIMOB-24248)
        to track this new feature.
