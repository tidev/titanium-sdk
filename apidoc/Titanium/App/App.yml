name: Titanium.App
summary: The top level App module. The App module is mainly used for accessing information about the application at runtime.
description: |
    The `App` module exposes a number of properties set in the `tiapp.xml` file.  
    
    Three of these properties, the application name, ID, and URL, must be specified when the 
    application is created.  
    
    While most values may be changed by editing the `tiapp.xml` file after creating the project, 
    the GUID is automatically generated and should not be changed.

extends: Titanium.Module
since: "0.1"

methods:
  - name: getArguments
    summary: Returns the arguments passed to the application on startup.
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
    returns:
        type: Dictionary

events:
  - name: proximity
    summary: Fired when the proximity sensor changes state.
    description: |
        The proximity sensor detects whether the device is being held up to the user's ear, 
        and shuts down the display.

        Proximity events are only fired when [proximityDetection](Titanium.App.proximityDetection) 
        is `true`.
    properties:
      - name: state
        summary: Proximity state value.
    platforms: [iphone]
    
  - name: resume
    summary: Fired when the application enters the foreground on a multitasked system.
    description: |
        Note that this event does not fire for pauses resulting from notifications or incoming phone calls.  
        
        See [applicationWillEnterForeground](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIApplication_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006728-CH3-SW108) 
        for the exact behavior that triggers this event.  
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
    
  - name: resumed
    summary: Fired when the application returns to focus.
    description: |
        This event fires when the application enters the foreground with the `resume` event or 
        returns to focus after notifications and incoming phone calls.  
        
        See [applicationDidBecomeActive](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIApplicationDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006786-CH3-SW10) 
        for the exact behavior that triggers this event.  
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]
    
  - name: pause
    summary: Fired when the application ceases being the focus. 
    description: |
        This event fires when the user leaves the application or it is paused due to notifications 
        and incoming phone calls.  
        
        See [applicationWillResignActive](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIApplicationDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006786-CH3-SW10) 
        for the exact behavior that triggers this event.  
        
        Note that calls to functions that modify the UI during this event may be partially executed, 
        **up to** the UI call before the suspension. If this happens, the **remainder** of the code 
        will be executed after the application is resumed, but before the `resume` event is triggered.
