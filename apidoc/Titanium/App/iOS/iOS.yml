    ### Local Notifications

    Local notifications are a way for an application that is not running in the foreground to let
    users know that it has information for them. When invoked, the application either displays a
    banner message or an alert dialog with a **Close** button to dismiss and an **Open** button to bring the application
    into the foreground. The application can also modify the icon badge, to show the
    number of pending notifications, and generate a sound.

    To send a local notification, the application needs to:

      1. Enroll the application to send local notifications with the
         <Titanium.App.iOS.registerUserNotificationSettings> method.
      2. Schedule a local notification with the <Titanium.App.iOS.scheduleLocalNotification> method.
      3. Monitor the [notification](Titanium.App.iOS.notification) event to respond to the
         notification.

    For instructions on sending local interactive notifications, see the
    [iOS Local Notifications guide](https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/iOS_Local_Notifications).

    ### Local Interactive Notifications

    You can create interactive notifications, where users can respond to application notifications
    without launching the application to the foreground. The user needs to reveal notification
    actions in the notification, then press a notification action to respond to the notification.

    To create an interactive notification, the application needs to:

      1. Create and configure notification actions with the
         <Titanium.App.iOS.createUserNotificationAction> method.
      2. Create notification categories and assign notification actions to them
         with the <Titanium.App.iOS.createUserNotificationCategory> method.
      3. Register the notification categories with the
         <Titanium.App.iOS.registerUserNotificationSettings> method.
      4. Monitor the [localnotificationaction](Titanium.App.iOS.localnotificationaction) event.

    For instructions on sending local interactive notifications, see the
    [iOS Local Notifications guide](https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/iOS_Local_Notifications).

    ### Background Downloads

    In iOS 7, Apple introduced new background execution modes which allow the application to download
    content in the background. These background modes are supported in Titanium SDK 3.2.0 and later.

    For more information on getting started, refer to the
    [iOS Background Services guide](https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/iOS_Background_Services).

    ### Handoff User Activities

    Handoff allows you to create and transfer user activies from one device to another. For example, you can start editing
    a document on your phone, then transfer the activity to your iPad to continue editing the document.

    To make an activity shareable, use the <Titanium.App.iOS.UserActivity> API to create the activity.
    To continue the activity on another device, listen for the
    [continueactivity](Titanium.App.iOS.continueactivity) event.

    ### Index Application Content

    In iOS 9 and later, Apple lets you index application content, such as music, videos, images and documents, to allow it
    to be searched in iOS Spotlight. To effectively add and remove information from the iOS search index
    you will need to use the following APIs:

    * <Titanium.App.iOS.SearchableItemAttributeSet> - Used to create metadata related to the `Ti.App.iOS.SearchableItem`
    * <Titanium.App.iOS.SearchableItem> - Used to assemble metadata into a unique object package to be used by `Ti.App.iOS.SearchableIndex`
    * <Titanium.App.iOS.SearchableIndex> - Used to add and remove `Ti.App.iOS.SearchableItem` objects to the device search index

  - name: backgroundfetch
    summary: Fired when the application is woken up for a fetch operation. Available only on iOS 7 and later.
    description: |
        Add this event if your app supports the `fetch` UIBackground mode. When an opportunity arises to
        download data, the system fires this event to give your app a chance to download any data it needs.
        Your callback of this event should download the data, prepare that data for use, and call the
        [endBackgroundHandler](Titanium.App.iOS.endBackgroundHandler) method with the `handlerID` parameter from this event.

        When this event is fired, your app has up to 30 seconds of wall-clock time to perform the download
        operation and call the `endBackgroundHandler` method. In practice,
        your app should call the `endBackgroundHandler` method as soon as possible
        after initiating the download. If you do not call the `endBackgroundHandler` method in time, your app is suspended.
        More importantly, the system uses the elapsed time to calculate power usage and data costs for your
        app's background downloads. If your app takes a long time to call `endBackgroundHandler` method, it may be given fewer
        future opportunities to fetch data in the future.

        If you are downloading large content, initiate the download using a
        [urlSession](Modules.URLSession) background download task, then call the `endBackgroundHandler` method.
        Listen for the [downloadcompleted](Titanium.App.iOS.downloadcompleted) event to prepare the data for use.

        The event returns the dictionary containing the `handlerID` property, which is a unique handler ID for the
        current event. This identifier should be passed as the argument to the
        [endBackgroundHandler](Titanium.App.iOS.endBackgroundHandler) method.

  - name: silentpush
    summary: Fired when the application is woken up by a silent remote notification. Available only on iOS 7 and later.
    description: |
        Add this event if your app supports the `remote-notification` UIBackground mode.
        This event is intended as a means for apps to minimize the time that elapses between
        the user seeing a push notification and the app displaying the associated data.
        When a push notification arrives, the system displays the notification to the user and
        launches the app in the background (if needed) so that it can call this event.
        Use this event to download any data related to the push notification. When your method
        is done, call the [endBackgroundHandler](Titanium.App.iOS.endBackgroundHandler) method with
        `handlerID` parameter from this event.

        The system fires this event regardless of the state of your app. If your app is suspended
        or not running, the system wakes up or launches your app and puts it into the background
        running state before firing the event.

        When this event is fired, your app has up to 30 seconds of wall-clock time to perform the download
        operation and call the `endBackgroundHandler` method. In practice,
        your app should call the `endBackgroundHandler` method as soon as possible
        after initiating the download. If you do not call the `endBackgroundHandler` method in time, your app is suspended.
        More importantly, the system uses the elapsed time to calculate power usage and data costs for your
        app's background downloads. If your app takes a long time to call `endBackgroundHandler` method, it may be given fewer
        future opportunities to fetch data in the future.

        If you are downloading large content, initiate the download using a
        [urlSession](Modules.URLSession) background download task, then call the `endBackgroundHandler` method.
        Listen for the [downloadcompleted](Titanium.App.iOS.downloadcompleted) event to prepare the data for use.

        The event returns the dictionary containing the `handlerID` property, which is a unique handler ID for the
        current event. This identifier should be passed as the argument to the
        [endBackgroundHandler](Titanium.App.iOS.endBackgroundHandler) method.

        You can send extra information with a silent push using extra:

        ``` js
        {
          aps: {
            'content-available': 1
          },
          extra: {
            foo: 'bar'
          }
        }
        ```

        In the event handler for <code>silentpush</code>, your code may look something like this:
        ``` json
        {
          "handlerId": "SilentPush-1415976886.375816",
          "aps": {

  - name: backgroundtransfer
    summary: |
        Fired when the events related to a [urlSession](Modules.URLSession) are waiting to be processed.
        Available only on iOS 7 and later.
    description: |
        The app fires this events when all background transfers associated with a `urlSession` object
        have finished or failed. Use this method to reconnect any `urlSession`s and to update your
        app's user interface. For example, you might use this method to update progress indicators
        or to incorporate new content into your views. After processing the events, call the
        [endBackgroundHandler](Titanium.App.iOS.endBackgroundHandler) method with the `handlerID`
        parameter. If a `urlSession` finishes its work when your app is not running, the system
        launches your app in the background so that it can process the event. In that situation,
        use the provided identifier to create a new `urlSessionConfiguration` and `urlSession` objects.
        Upon creating urlSession object, that object calls the appropriate delegate methods to
        process the events.

        If your app already has a session object with the specified identifier and is running or suspended,
        you do not need to create a new session object using this method. Suspended apps are moved into the
        background. As soon as the app is running again, the `urlSession` object with the identifier receives
        the events and processes them normally.

        At launch time, the app does not call this method if there are uploads or downloads in progress.
        If you want to display the current progress of those transfers in your app's user
        interface, you must recreate the session object yourself. In that situation, cache the session
        identifier value persistently and use it to recreate your session object.

    properties:
      - name: handlerId
        summary: |
            Unique string identifier for the `backgroundtransfer` event. This identifier should be passed as the argument

    description: |
        This event only needs to be used if your app is using the `urlSession` module to download data.

        In iOS, when a background transfer completes and if your app is no longer running, your app
        is automatically relaunched in the background, and the app fires the [backgroundtransfer](Titanium.App.iOS.backgroundtransfer) event.
        This event should contain the identifier of the session that caused your app to be launched.
        Your app should then store that `handlerID` before creating a background session configuration object
        with the same identifier, and creating a url session object with that configuration.
        The newly created session is automatically reassociated with ongoing background activity.

        When your app later receives a `sessioneventscompleted` event, this indicates that
        all messages previously enqueued for this session have been delivered, and that it
        is now safe to invoke [endBackgroundHandler](Titanium.App.iOS.endBackgroundHandler)
        method with the `handlerID` or to begin any internal updates that may result in invoking
        this method.
