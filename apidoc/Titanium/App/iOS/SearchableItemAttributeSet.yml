  - title: Creating a new SearchableItemAttributeSet Example
    example: |
        The following example demonstrates how to create a new Ti.App.iOS.SearchableItem and 
        add a Ti.App.iOS.SearchableItemAttributeSet. The Ti.App.iOS.SearchableItem is then
        Ti.App.iOS.SearchableIndex is used to add the Ti.App.iOS.SearchableItem to the default search index.
                
        #### app.js
            
            var searchItems = [];
            var itemAttr = Ti.App.iOS.createSearchableItemAttributeSet({
                itemContentType:"public.image",
                title:"Titanium Core Spotlight Tutorial"                
            });
            
            itemAttr.contentDescription ="Tech Example \nOn: " + String.formatDate(new Date(),"short");
            itemAttr.keywords =["Mobile","Appcelerator","Titanium"];

            var item = Ti.App.iOS.createSearchableItem({
                identifier:"my-id",
                domainIdentifier:"com.mydomain",
                attributeSet:itemAttr
            });
            searchItems.push(item);

            var indexer = Ti.App.iOS.createSearchableIndex();

            indexer.AddToDefaultSearchableIndex(searchItems,function(e){
                if(e.success){
                    alert("Press the home button and now search for your keywords");
                }else{
                    alert("Errored: " + JSON.stringify(e.error));
                }
            });
