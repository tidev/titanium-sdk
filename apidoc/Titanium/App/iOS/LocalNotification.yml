name: Titanium.App.iOS.LocalNotification
summary: A local notification to alert the user of new or pending application information.
description: |
    A LocalNotification is created by <Titanium.App.iOS.scheduleLocalNotification>.  

    Local notifications are a way for an application that is not running in the foreground to let
    users know that it has information for them. When invoked, the application either displays a
    banner message or an alert dialog with a **Close** button to dismiss and an **Open** button to bring the application
    into the foreground. The application can also modify the icon badge, to show the
    number of pending notifications, and generate a sound.
