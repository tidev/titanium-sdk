name: Titanium.App.iOS.BackgroundService
summary: A service that runs when the application is placed in the background.
extends: Titanium.Proxy
platforms: [iphone,ipad]
since: "1.5"
createable: false
properties:
  - name: url
    summary: A local URL to a JavaScript file containing the code to run in the background.
    type: String
    availability: creation
    default: none
methods:
  - name: stop
    summary: Stops the service from running during the current background session to conserve resources.
    description: |
        Currently, calling `stop` both halts the current execution of the background 
        service, **and** unregisters it, so that it will not run again unless it is re-registered.
        This is a known issue.
  - name: unregister
    summary: Unregisters the background service.

    The BackgroundService is created by <Titanium.App.iOS.registerBackgroundService>.  
    
    When a background service is created, a local URL to a JavaScript file must be defined. The code 
    it contains is executed each time the application is no longer the focus or, in other words, the 
    <Titanium.App.pause> event is fired.

    The background service runs when the application is placed in the background and will 
    continue to run until one of the following occurs:
    
    * The application resumes.

    * The service is stopped with the `stop` method.
    
    * The OS terminates the service for one of the reasons discussed in 
      "Background Service Limitations", below.

    #### Known Issues 

    Note that there are several issues with the current implementation of 
    background services:

    * The background service runs when the Application is placed in the background and will 
      continue to run until the service is stopped with the `stop` method, however, this also
      unregisters the service.

    * Calling `unregister` on the background service *unregisters* the service, but does not
      stop the background task under which the service was launched. This can lead to having
      multiple tasks running in the background.

    * Calling `register` multiple times with the same URL results in multiple instances of
      the same service being run.
    
    These issues will be addressed in a future release. To work around these issues, the
    application must:

    * Unregister the background service when the application resumes.

    * Re-register the background service when the application pauses.
    
    #### Background Service Limitations

    Note that even with these workarounds, the background service is subject to limitations
    imposed by the operating system. In particular:

    * The OS limits the total amount of time the background service can run for after the 
      application is suspended, typically to no more than 10 minutes.

    * The OS may terminate the background service at any point to reclaim resources.
