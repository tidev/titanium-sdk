summary: The top level Cloud module.
description: |
    Appcelerator Cloud Services (ACS) provides a wide array of automatically-scaled data storage 
    and web services, such as user logins, photo uploads, checkins, status updates, and push 
    notifications, without the need to learn multiple third-party SDKs or do any 
    server-side programming. Remote calls to ACS are done via a single 
    [REST API](http://cloud.appcelerator.com/docs/docmenu_info), which may be used with almost any 
    web technology that has access to an HTTP client.
    
    The `Titanium.Cloud` module makes accessing ACS as simple as using any of Titanium's other APIs, 
    due to its familiar and intuitive API schema. 
    
    For a more detailed overview of ACS and how to configure an application to use it, refer to the 
    [Integrating with Appcelerator Cloud
    Services](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/guide/Integrating_with_Appcelerator_Cloud_Services) 
    and [ACS Quickstart](http://cloud.appcelerator.com/docs/quickstart) guides. 
    
    #### Beta ACS APIs
    
    Be aware that ACS APIs that are in pre-release form (marked "Beta" in the 
    [ACS documentation](http://cloud.appcelerator.com/docs/docmenu_info)) may be subject to change. 
    During this period, while they are not supported directly by the Titanium.Cloud module, 
    they may be accessed using the REST API. 
    
    #### Using the Titanium.Cloud Module
    
    This module is not included in the Titanium namespace, but it is bundled with the
    Titanium SDK as an optional CommonJS module. To use it, import the module using
    `require`: 
    
        var Cloud = require('ti.cloud');
    
    #### Authentication

    Your app must prove that it is allowed to talk to ACS. This keeps your data secure by 
    preventing anyone from making requests to ACS that impersonate your app. ACS provides 
    several means of authentication:

    *   3-Legged OAuth. With 3-legged OAuth, the user and application are authenticated
        at the same time. User login (or signup) is done using a separate authentication
        server, which returns a time-limited access token to the application. The
        application uses the access token to authenticate all subsequent requests. 

    *   2-Legged OAuth. This is a process by which a key and secret are used to sign
        each request made by your app. When the ACS server receives your request,
        the secret is used along with the data sent in the request to calculate another
        signature. If sent signature and calculated signature match, the request will be processed.

    *   API Key. In this method, the application passes a pre-provisioned API key with
        each request.

    When using 2-Legged OAuth or API key authentication, the application presents its 
    own UI to prompt the user for username and password. Then the application calls 
    [login](Titanium.Cloud.Users.login) or [create](Titanium.Cloud.Users.create) method
    to authenticate the user, passing in the  username and password. 
    Once logged in, the application can store the [sessionId](Titanium.Cloud.sessionId) returned 
    by ACS in secure storage in order to persist the session when the application restarts. 

    When using 3-Legged  OAuth, the module presents an authentication dialog to the
    user when [secureLogin](Titanium.Cloud.Users.secureLogin) or
    [secureCreate](Titanium.Cloud.Users.secureCreate) method is called. The user's
    login and password are not available to the application. The application can store the
    [accessToken](Titanium.Cloud.accessToken) returned by the authentication server in
    secure storage so that it does not need to present the login dialog each time the application
    restarts. Unlike session IDs, however, access tokens expire after a period of time.
    The application owner can configure the expiration time through the ACS website.

    The Ti.Cloud module does not provide a mechanism for securely storing a `sessionId` or
    `accessToken`; the application must provide storage that matches its security
    requirements.

    By default, Ti.Cloud always uses SSL for communicating with the ACS servers, unless
    the [useSecure](Titanium.Cloud.useSecure) flag is set to `false`.

    3-Legged OAuth, using [secureLogin](Titanium.Cloud.Users.secureLogin) and
    [secureCreate](Titanium.Cloud.Users.secureCreate) is the preferred authentication
    method in most cases. However, if your application is using 3-Legged OAuth, all of its
    clients must use 3-Legged OAuth, so there may be cases where another authentication
    strategy is required.
    
    #### tiapp.xml Properties

    Titanium Studio will create a pair of keys (Development and Production) for each Titanium 
    application depending on the user preference specified during new project creation. This pair 
    of keys will be stored in `tiapp.xml` and one of the keys will be used during application build 
    depending on the build type (development or production). 
    
    The supported properties in `tiapp.xml` are: 
    
        <property name="acs-api-key-development" type="string">YOUR DEVELOPMENT API KEY HERE</property>
        <property name="acs-oauth-key-development" type="string">YOUR DEVELOPMENT OAUTH KEY HERE</property>
        <property name="acs-oauth-secret-development" type="string">YOUR DEVELOPMENT OAUTH SECRET HERE</property>
        
        <property name="acs-api-key-production" type="string">YOUR PRODUCTION API KEY HERE</property>
        <property name="acs-oauth-key-production" type="string">YOUR PRODUCTION OAUTH KEY HERE</property>
        <property name="acs-oauth-secret-production" type="string">YOUR PRODUCTION OAUTH SECRET HERE</property>
        
        <property name="acs-api-key" type="string">YOUR API KEY HERE</property>
        <property name="acs-oauth-key" type="string">YOUR OAUTH KEY HERE</property>
        <property name="acs-oauth-secret" type="string">YOUR OAUTH SECRET HERE</property>
    
    The value for each setting that will be used is based on the following rules: 
    
    * apiKey is preferred over OAuth. If apiKey is provided then 
      apiKey will be used; otherwise, OAuth will be used.
    * If a deployment-specific setting is provided (production or development) then that value will 
      be used for the current deployment environment.
    
    There is also an optional setting to allow you to change the base URL for ACS requests. You 
    will most likely never need to specify this. It can be specified deployment-specific, or 
    generic: 
    
        <property name="acs-base-url-development" type="string">DEVELOPMENT API URL HERE</property>
        <property name="acs-base-url-production" type="string">PRODUCTION API URL HERE</property>
        <property name="acs-base-url" type="string">API URL HERE</property>

        <property name="acs-authbase-url-development" type="string">AUTHENTICATION URL HERE</property>
        <property name="acs-authbase-url-production" type="string">AUTHENTICATION URL HERE</property>
        <property name="acs-authbase-url" type="string">AUTHENTICATION URL HERE</property>
