name: Titanium.Contacts.Person
summary: |
    An object that represents a contact record for a person or organization in the system contacts 
    address book.
description: |
    A person object is created using <Titanium.Contacts.createPerson>.
    
    The following two kinds of properties exist for this object:
    
    * single value - contains either a `string` or `number` type value, an array of `string` type 
    values, or `null` if unset.
    * multi-value - contains a dictionary with typical keys of `home`, `work` and/or `other`. Each 
    key contains either a `string` type value, an array of `string` type values, or a dictionary 
    containing key/value pairs with `string` type values.
    
    #### Adding and Modifying Properties
    
    Support for adding and modifying properties is currently supported on iOS and Android.
    
    #### Keys as Address Book UI Labels
    
    Keys act as labels in the address book user interface.
    
    Although there is limited support for custom, arbitrarily-named, keys when used with multi-value 
    properties, there is no support them with single value properties.
    
    On iOS, creating custom keys is not recommended, and will lead to undefined results.
    
    If a label has been created by the user of the device and used with a multi-value property, it 
    will exist as a key with the same name.
    
    See examples in <Titanium.Contacts> for more information.

    These APIs are unavailable on macOS if the app is built on a version of Xcode < 12.

        codes, and determines the format in which the contact is presented by the address book 
        user interface. See the wikipedia section
